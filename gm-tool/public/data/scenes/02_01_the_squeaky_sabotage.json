    "opening": "A delivery truck sits at an angle in the middle of Main Street, its back doors flung open and its cargo spilled across the asphalt.",
    "perspective": "The noise is *unbearable*. Every dog in Silverfield seems to have converged on this spot, and they're all squeaking toys at once. The high-pitched *squeak-squeak-squeak* hits frequencies that make your skull vibrate. Your ears flatten against your head, but it doesn't help. The sound is everywhere, relentless, drilling into your brain.\n\nThe smell of rubber and cheap plastic is thick enough to taste. Mixed with it is the hot, panting breath of dozens of overexcited dogs—a wave of canine enthusiasm that's almost visible. The street is a sea of bouncing, chomping, frantically wagging tails, each dog lost in a squeaky frenzy. They're not aggressive, but they're also not *aware*. A German Shepherd bounds past, narrowly missing you, a rubber duck clamped in her jaws.\n\nThe asphalt is warm under your paws from the afternoon sun, but also slick in places where toys have rolled. You can feel the vibrations of dozens of paws hitting pavement, of tails thumping, of toys being shaken and thrown. It's chaos incarnate, and right in the middle of it all, a flustered human is shouting into a phone while trying to corral the madness.\n\nAnd then you notice: the truck's brake lines, dangling beneath the chassis. They're not broken—they're *chewed*. Cleanly. Deliberately."

    "opening": "Success! You've secured the catch—crates of fresh lobsters, claws snapping indignantly, seawater dripping between the slats. Sappho and Jewels slip away early with the choicest hauls, exchanging a private look before they disappear into the gathering twilight. \"We'll take these to the feast site,\" Sappho calls back, her tail wagging. \"You all did great!\" The rest of the allied dogs and lynx mill about, helping to organize the remaining catch, everyone still chattering together as the work winds down.\n\nBut then the sky darkens—not with night, but with wings.",
    "perspective": "The Gull Mafia descends like a feathered storm. Dozens, no, *hundreds* of seagulls, working together with terrifying coordination. The sound is overwhelming—a wall of screeching that hits frequencies only you can hear, piercing and relentless. Every nerve in your body screams *RUN*, but there's nowhere to go.\n\nThe air pressure changes as hundreds of wings beat at once. You feel it in your whiskers, in your inner ear—a buffeting, disorienting turbulence that makes it hard to keep your balance. Gulls dive past close enough that their wingtips brush your fur, and each near-miss sends a jolt of adrenaline through your system.\n\nAt the height of the battle with the gulls, you feel it—a sudden, visceral *wrongness* that ripples through the air like thunder without sound. Somewhere in the woods, far from your eyes, something terrible has happened. The magical backlash *tastes* like copper and smells like ozone. A wave of magical energy washes over the docks. In an instant, all inter-species communication is severed. The barks of the Sea Dogs become incomprehensible noise. The yowls of the Lynx turn to gibberish.\n\nPanic erupts. The other dogs and lynx involved in the heist fall into disarray, barking and yowling accusations at each other that neither side can understand. \"Betrayal!\" \"Treachery!\" They scatter in confusion and fear, the fragile alliance shattered as suddenly as the Stone itself.\n\nAnd Sappho and Jewels? They're gone. They left minutes ago with the catch, heading to the staging area near the old logging woods. What happened to them?"

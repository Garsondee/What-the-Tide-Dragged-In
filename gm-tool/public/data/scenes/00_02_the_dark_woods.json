    "opening": "The path to the Darkwoods narrows as you leave the familiar streets and alleyways of Silverfield behind. The transition is abrupt—one moment you're padding along cracked pavement under streetlamps, the next you're stepping onto soft earth beneath a canopy so thick it swallows the twilight whole.",
    "perspective": "The air changes immediately: *cooler*, much cooler. Your fur fluffs involuntarily against the sudden chill. You can feel the temperature drop through your paw pads as they leave sun-warmed concrete for cold forest loam. The earth is soft, damp, giving beneath your weight in an unsettling way—so different from the solid certainty of pavement. Pine needles prick between your toe beans.\n\nThe *scent* is overwhelming—sharp green resin from ancient pines, wet moss, decomposing leaves, and underneath it all, layer upon layer of *lynx*. Territory markers everywhere, some fresh, some old, all screaming the same message: \"THIS IS OURS. YOU DON'T BELONG.\" Your instincts scream at you to turn back, that you're in another predator's domain, that you're *prey-sized* here.\n\nAhead, the path—if it can even be called that—leads deeper into darkness. But before you can take more than a few steps, you hear it: a low, resonant growl that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Then, movement.\n\nA massive lynx emerges from between the trees, stepping into what little light filters through the canopy. This is Big Lynx, elder of the Lynx clan, and their size and bearing make it clear why they hold that title. They're *enormous*—easily three times your size, maybe four. Their paws are as big as your head."

It's old, older than Silverfield itself, carved with spiraling glyphs that hurt to look at directly. The stone thrums beneath your paw when you touch it, a steady pulse like a heartbeat. There's power here, but it's strained somehow, like a rope pulled too tight. The pattern of the wards should form a perfect circle, but one stone is dark, its glow extinguished. If you know anything about magical defenses, you realize this: the wards aren't just keeping intruders out. They're keeping something in. Or they were, until recently. The broken stone suggests the barrier has been compromised."

The elder lynx exchanges a glance with Jewels, and some silent communication passes between them. \"You know, then,\" Big Lynx says quietly, almost to themselves. \"Or you suspect.\" They pad closer, lowering their voice so only your group can hear. \"Three nights past, we found signs at the eastern boundary—paw prints that appeared and vanished mid-stride, strange scents that shift and change. And the animals... we've heard the song. A flute, played in the deep woods where no human should be. Those who hear it wander toward it, entranced. We've lost two of our own cubs. They walked into the trees and did not return.\""

Someone or something passed through here recently that had been near the Animal Control facility. The trail leads deeper into the woods, toward where the flute music supposedly originates."

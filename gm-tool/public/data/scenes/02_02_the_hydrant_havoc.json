    "opening": "Every fire hydrant on Maple Street has burst open at once, turning the road into a rushing river.",
    "perspective": "*Water.* The street is nothing but *water*. Your worst nightmare. The smell hits you first—chlorine, rust, the metallic tang of old pipes—mixed with the sweet, horrible scent of wet dog. The sound is overwhelming: rushing water, splashing paws, barking laughter. You can hear the hydraulic *hiss* of the hydrants, each one spraying at full pressure, the water hitting pavement with enough force to send vibrations up through your paws.\n\nYour fur prickles with horror. Even standing here, three feet from the nearest stream, you can feel the humidity weighing down your coat. One splash and you'll be *soaked*. The thought makes your stomach clench. Cats aren't meant for this.\n\nThe dogs, of course, are in heaven. They leap and bound through the fountains, tongues lolling, tails helicoptering with joy. A golden retriever belly-flops into a puddle the size of a small pond, sending up a wave that makes you leap backward with a hiss. Their scent is everywhere—wet fur, dog joy, salt and sweat. It's disgusting.\n\nAbove you, along fire escapes and windowsills, the local alley cats are in full fury. Their yowls of rage need no translation. One bedraggled tabby perches on a third-floor escape, her fur plastered flat, looking like a drowned rat. She's hissing non-stop, eyes fixed on the dogs below.\n\nYou pick your way carefully along the edge of a building, paws finding the narrow strip of dry concrete. But the water's rising. Soon there won't be any dry path at all."

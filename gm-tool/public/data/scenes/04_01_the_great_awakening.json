    "opening": "The Speaking Stone rests at the center of the gathering, whole and radiant. Its jade heart pulses with gentle warmth, and the shell fragments around it gleam with renewed purpose. The impossible has happened: universal communication has been restored—and expanded beyond anyone's wildest dreams.",
    "perspective": "Around you, the world has transformed. Zoo animals who lived their lives in cages now speak with eloquence and fury. Dogs and lynx converse freely with cats. The barriers that once divided Silverfield's animal society have shattered, replaced by something vast and uncertain.\n\nSappho and Jewels stand together at the heart of it all, their paws intertwined, a living symbol of what this moment represents. Love bridging divides. Unity forged from chaos. Hope born from crisis.\n\nBut celebration is tempered by reality. Mehitabel and Ra sit bound and guarded, awaiting judgment. Faction leaders—old and new—eye each other warily, uncertain of where they fit in this brave new world. And the question hangs in the air, unspoken but impossible to ignore: What comes next?"

The players can help establish the groundwork for a new, all-encompassing \"United Parliament of Silverfield.\" They are awarded a significant milestone for fundamentally changing their world."

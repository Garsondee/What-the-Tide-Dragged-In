# 🎉 Recent Improvements Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Deployed

---

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Wider Right Sidebar** (+20% space)
**Change:** Increased from 352px (w-88) to 420px  
**Why:** Gives task list more breathing room  
**Impact:** Better readability, less cramped UI

---

### 2. **Inline Task Checkboxes** 🎯
**Location:** Main scene content (left side)  
**Synced with:** Right sidebar task panel

**Now checkable inline:**
- ☐ Levers & Buttons (GM Guidance)
- ☐ Hidden Aspects
- ☐ Breadcrumbs
- ☐ Potential Outcomes
- ☐ As Scene Unfolds events
- ☐ NPC Introductions

**How it works:**
- Check a box in the main content → Updates right sidebar
- Check a box in right sidebar → Updates main content
- **Bi-directional sync** - tick either one, both update!

**UX Benefit:** GMs can tick things off organically as they happen during play, without switching focus to the sidebar.

### 3. **Config Panel** ⚙️
**Access:** Click "Config" button in top navigation  
**Features:**

### 4. **Enhanced Navigation Dialog** 💬
**Replaced:** Native `confirm()` dialog  
**New Design:** Beautiful custom modal with clear buttons

**Three clear options:**
1. ✅ **Complete Scene and Continue** (Green) - Marks complete + navigates
2. → **Continue Without Completing** (Gray) - Just navigates
3. ❌ **Cancel Navigation** (Link) - Stay on current scene

**UX Improvement:** No more confusing OK/Cancel buttons!

### Key Concepts

**Bi-Directional Sync:**
Both locations (inline & sidebar) share the same data source (`taskTracking` composable), so updating one automatically updates the other through Vue's reactivity.

**Task IDs:**
Each task has a unique ID like `lever-0`, `hidden-2`, `npc-1`. This ensures the same task checkbox works the same way wherever it appears.

**Config Panel Architecture:**
Uses Vue's Teleport to render as a modal overlay. Imports composables directly to access and modify all progress data.

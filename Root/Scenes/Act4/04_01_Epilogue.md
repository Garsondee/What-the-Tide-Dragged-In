# Act 4, Scene 1: The Great Awakening

**Central Question:** Now that the world has changed forever, what comes next?

**Situation Aspects:**
*   **A World Transformed:** Dozens of new species are now sentient and speaking.
*   **The Unspoken Question:** What is to be done with Mehitabel and Ra?
*   **A Cacophony of New Voices:** The old order is gone; a new, more complex one must be built.

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Sappho & Jewels:** Ambassadors for a new era of inter-species cooperation.
*   **Faction Leaders (Old and New):** Representatives from the established factions and the newly awakened zoo animals.
*   **Mehitabel & Ra:** Imprisoned and awaiting judgment.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   This is a narrative scene focused on the world-building consequences of the players' actions. They are hailed as heroes, but the celebration is tempered by the immense challenge of integrating so many new minds into society. The decision is made to hold the shapeshifters for a formal trial, creating a direct hook for the next adventure. The players can help establish the groundwork for a new, all-encompassing "United Parliament of Silverfield." They are awarded a significant milestone for fundamentally changing their world.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Set Agenda:** Create Advantage with Rapport/Lore to define the first charter items (rights, safety, representation); place "Draft Charter Articles" with free invokes.
  - **Mediate Justice:** Will/Empathy to balance calls for vengeance vs trial for Mehitabel & Ra; aspect "Legitimate Process" avoids mob justice.
  - **Assign Roles:** Contacts/Rapport to propose ambassadors, wardens, translators; create "Working Committees" for future leverage.
  - **Public Narrative:** Provoke/Rapport to frame the awakening as hopeful; reduce future social opposition.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Uneasy Factions** (Empathy): Old grudges simmer beneath unity; can be invoked/compelled in future politics.
  - **Paper Trail Fragments** (Investigate): Documents recovered point to outside backers for the shifters.
  - **Awakened Outliers** (Notice): Non-zoo species showing signs of awakening—scope is expanding.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - A sealed letter marked with the unknown sigil from earlier clues (hook to next arc’s patron).
  - Trial date set; needs advocates, evidence, and security—mini-arc setup.

- **Integrate Consequences**
  - Surface scene/character consequences from prior acts (Public Outcry, faction wounds) and convert into standing campaign aspects or debts.
  - Offer milestones: minor for participation, significant for pivotal choices; consider major if the world order shift was dramatic.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Talks fracture into committees that bicker off-stage, but the PCs walk away with authority to act, plus one concrete resource or ally.
  - Public skepticism grows, but PCs secure evidence against the shifters’ patrons, priming the next investigation.

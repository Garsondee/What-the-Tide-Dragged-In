# Act 0, Scene 1: The Cat Parliament

**Central Question:** Can the players restore order to the chaotic parliament and learn the source of the disturbance?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

The evening air hangs thick with tension as you approach the old stone amphitheater where the Cat Parliament convenes. Dusk paints the sky in bruised purples and fading golds, and the noise hits you before you even round the corner—a cacophony of yowls, hisses, and caterwauling that would put a midnight alley brawl to shame. This is supposed to be a dignified gathering, the weekly assembly where the cats of Silverfield debate matters of territory, resource allocation, and collective defense. Instead, chaos reigns.

The amphitheater itself is a repurposed human ruin, semicircular stone benches arranged in tiers around a central speaking floor. Normally, the Speaker—an elder tabby of impeccable bearing—would stand at the center with the ceremonial Speaking Gavel, maintaining order with a single sharp tap. But tonight, the center is empty. The gavel lies abandoned on the stone, and without that anchor of authority, the parliament has devolved into a dozen shouting matches at once.

Cats of every stripe and size perch on the benches or prowl the aisles. You see the sleek Siamese representatives of the Harborfront faction gesticulating wildly at a cluster of burly alley cats from the Warehouse District. A Maine Coon elder is trying—and failing—to shout over three orange tabbies who appear to be conducting their own counter-meeting. Scraps of parchment flutter in the wind, knocked from podiums and benches. The scent of fur and frustration is thick in the air.

And there, at the very edge of the amphitheater, sitting awkwardly on the lowest bench like an uninvited guest at a formal dinner, is Sappho. The piratical Labrador cuts an unusual figure—a dog at a cat parliament is already strange, but everything about her screams urgency. Her golden coat is matted with salt spray and forest debris, her eyes dart nervously between the arguing factions, and her tail wags in fitful, anxious jerks. She's clearly been waiting for a chance to speak, but the chaos makes that impossible. Every time she shifts forward, a nearby cat shoots her a warning glare or hiss, and she settles back down, ears flat with worry.

What draws your attention immediately:
- **The Empty Center:** The Speaking Gavel lies unattended. Anyone could seize it, if they dared challenge the implicit authority of the missing Speaker.
- **The Factions:** The parliament has fractured into at least four distinct groups, each more concerned with shouting down the others than listening. You recognize faces—allies, rivals, cats who owe you favors or hold grudges.
- **The Outsider:** Sappho stands out like a beacon. Her body language screams that she has something important to say, but she's being shut out.
- **The Debris:** Papers scatter across the stone floor—meeting agendas, territorial maps, notes. Some are being trampled, others flutter just out of reach.
- **The Acoustics:** The amphitheater amplifies everything. A clever cat could use that to command attention—or cause an even bigger distraction.

The question is: how do you restore order, or at least create enough of a pause to learn what Sappho desperately needs to tell you?

## As the Scene Unfolds

**If players investigate the scattered papers (Investigate/Notice):**

Sifting through the debris, you find a half-trampled agenda sheet. The header reads "72nd Session of the Silverfield Cat Parliament" in the Speaker's precise paw-script. Most of the items are routine—disputes over alley boundaries, a motion to expand the catnip garden cooperative—but one line near the bottom catches your eye, hastily scrawled and marked with an urgent asterisk:

*"Motion to Address: Disappearances near the Darkwoods boundary. Four cats, two dogs, one lynx reported missing over the past moon. Concerns raised by Slynx emissary and Sea Dog representatives. PRIORITY DISCUSSION."*

Below it, in a different paw—messier, worried—someone has added: "Where is the Speaker? She went to investigate the tree-line two days ago and hasn't returned."

**If players observe the rival faction closely (Notice/Empathy):**

You notice a tight cluster of three cats near the back—a scarred tomcat flanked by two younger, aggressive-looking allies. They're not participating in the general shouting; instead, they're whispering among themselves, shooting dark looks at Sappho. You catch fragments of their conversation:

"...perfect opportunity..."
"...dogs bring nothing but trouble..."
"...if we frame this right, we can turn the whole parliament against their kind..."

They're waiting for the chaos to reach a crescendo, planning to use Sappho's presence as a wedge issue to consolidate their own power.

**If players watch Sappho closely (Empathy/Notice):**

Sappho's anxiety isn't random. Every thirty seconds or so, she taps her tail against the stone bench in a deliberate rhythm: *tap-tap, pause, tap, pause, tap-tap-tap*. It's not nervous fidgeting—it's a signal, repeated over and over. If you know Sea Dog signal codes (or make a good guess), it translates roughly to: "Urgent. Private. Now."

She's trying to tell you she needs to speak away from the crowd, somewhere the parliament can't overhear or interfere.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Cats in Chaos
*   Dusk Falls
*   Missing Speaker

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Sappho:** A piratical dog sitting nervously on the outskirts, waiting for a chance to speak.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **Sappho (in Dog-Conlang, if approached before communication is established):** "Help... vanishing... Darkwoods... must follow..."

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players manage to calm the parliament, either through diplomacy, intimidation, or clever maneuvering. They get the key information from Sappho: animals are vanishing into the Darkwoods, and he needs their help to follow.
*   **Success with a Cost:** The players restore order, but not before a rival cat makes a power play, creating a future complication. Or, they learn the information from Sappho, but have angered a faction within the parliament.
*   **Failure:** The chaos continues, and the players must find another way to get the information from Sappho, perhaps by sneaking away from the dysfunctional meeting. This could lead to them being seen as irresponsible by the parliament later on.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Calm the Floor:** Overcome with Rapport/Provoke/Will to quiet factions. Success unlocks Sappho’s approach; a tie grants a one-use boost like "Momentary Silence".
  - **Spot the Speaker’s Notes:** Investigate/Notice to find discarded agenda notes hinting at recent disappearances and a planned motion about the Darkwoods.
  - **Use Procedure:** Create Advantage with Lore/Contacts to invoke "Rules of Order" and seize the mic.
  - **Stage a Distraction:** Create Advantage with Deceive/Athletics to split the room and open a path to Sappho.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Buried Agenda Item** (discover via Investigate): Mentions reports of missing animals near the Darkwoods.
  - **Rival Faction Whispering** (discover via Notice): A clique wants to pin chaos on dogs; compel later to escalate tensions.
  - **Sappho’s Secret Signal** (discover via Empathy/Notice): A subtle tail tap pattern; reading it grants a free invoke to "Private Parley" with Sappho.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Sappho points to the Darkwoods gate and a lynx gatekeeper (leads to Scene 2).
  - Notes reference a broken relic called the "Speaking Stone" (foreshadows Act 1 Scene 2 twist).
  - Whispered rumor: "New faces among the lynx" (soft ping toward shapeshifters).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Chaos continues but a sympathetic clerk slips them the agenda note (reveal Darkwoods lead anyway, at a cost/aspect like "On the Parliament’s Bad Side").
  - An ejection from the hall creates a scene aspect **Thrown Out Into Dusk** granting stealthier access to Sappho outside.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - Sappho’s Trouble or factional pride to stall the PCs until they make a concrete promise.
  - Any PC Trouble tied to authority or impulse; trade time for information.

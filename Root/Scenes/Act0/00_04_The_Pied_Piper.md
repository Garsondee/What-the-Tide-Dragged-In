# Act 0, Scene 4: The Pied Piper

**Central Question:** How will the players neutralize Wally and his magical flute?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

Up close, Wally's shack is even more pathetic than it looked from a distance. The walls lean at impossible angles, held together by hope, duct tape, and what might be sheer theatrical stubbornness. Faded posters peel from the exterior—"WALLY'S WANDERING WONDERS! MAGIC! MYSTERY! MIRTH!"—alongside crude illustrations of rabbits in hats and doves in flight. The whole structure smells of mildew, sawdust, and something chemical and acrid, like the air after fireworks.

The music is deafening now, so loud it vibrates in your bones. Through the gaps in the walls, you can see him.

Wally is... not what you expected. He's a small human, rail-thin, with wild hair that might have once been styled but now sticks up in greasy spikes. His coat is threadbare velvet, once deep purple but now faded to the color of old bruises, and it's decorated with tarnished brass buttons and moth-eaten gold trim. He's standing in the center of the shack, eyes closed in what looks like ecstasy, swaying as he plays. The flute in his hands gleams with an unnatural silver light, and the notes that pour from it seem to warp the very air, making it shimmer and twist like heat rising from summer pavement.

The interior is chaos incarnate. Boxes and trunks are stacked haphazardly against every wall, labeled with fading magic marker: "TRICK DOVES (DEAD)", "SPARE WANDS", "FLASH PAPER - FLAMMABLE". A moth-eaten rabbit pelt hangs from a nail. A cracked crystal ball sits forgotten in one corner. Everywhere, there's the detritus of a failed career—bent playing cards, tangled silk scarves, a saw marked "FOR LADY IN BOX ROUTINE" that's crusted with rust.

But it's the flute that holds your attention. Silver, ornate, covered in etchings that hurt to look at. When Wally hits certain notes, those etchings *glow*, pulsing in time with the music. This isn't a prop. This is the real thing, genuine magic in the hands of someone who has absolutely no idea how to control it—or doesn't care.

"Yes, YES!" Wally laughs, eyes still closed, voice cracking with manic glee. "Finally! FINALLY they have to listen! No more rotten tomatoes, no more being booed off stage by ungrateful brats! Look at them out there—an AUDIENCE! A proper audience! They can't leave, can't boo, can't throw things! They have to WATCH!"

He spins, and for a moment his eyes crack open, wild and fever-bright. "And if I don't stop? If I just keep playing? Then they'll follow me EVERYWHERE! Through the town, past the stages that rejected me, right up to the doorsteps of every venue manager who ever called me a hack! They'll SEE! They'll ALL see that Wally the Wanderer is a TRUE magician!"

What you notice:
- **The Flute:** It's the source. Stop the music, stop the spell. But Wally's holding it tight, and he's larger than you. A direct fight is possible but risky.
- **The Structure:** The shack is barely standing. One good shove in the right place might collapse walls, create a distraction, or even trap Wally temporarily.
- **The Boxes:** They're full of stage props and old tricks. Some might be useful. You can see flash paper (highly flammable), tangled ropes, even what looks like a small fog machine.
- **The Back Exit:** There's a poorly concealed door behind a hanging curtain at the shack's rear. If things go sideways, it's an escape route—or possibly an ambush opportunity.
- **The Music's Focus:** Wally has to concentrate to maintain the spell. Anything that breaks his concentration might weaken the hold on the animals outside.
- **The Props:** A wooden trunk near Wally's feet is half-open, revealing more paraphernalia. Something glints inside—glass? Metal?

How do you silence the Piper before his madness causes real harm?

## As the Scene Unfolds

**If players investigate the half-open trunk (Notice/Investigate):**

Peering into the trunk while staying low, you spot several interesting items:

A cracked glass vial, still leaking a thin, oily substance that smells sharp and chemical. The label, barely legible, reads "Stage Voice Amplifier—Alchemical Solution." There are droplets on the flute's mouthpiece. Whatever this stuff is, it's enhancing the magic, making the sound carry farther and hit harder. If you could break the vial or smash it, the flute's power might diminish significantly.

Beneath it, a rolled-up sheaf of papers—show notes, it looks like. One page is marked "UPCOMING GIGS" with several entries scratched out in frustration. But one remains, circled multiple times in red: "ZOO CHARITY EVENT - CONTACT: R. - PAYMENT: $500 + SPECIAL PROP." There's a crude drawing of something in the margin: a silver tag on a chain. Whoever this "R" is, they might have given Wally the flute—or at least pointed him toward it.

There's also a hardware store receipt, crumpled but readable. It lists "specialty wrench set (imported)" and a delivery address in town. The same kind of receipt you might have seen near the hydrants if you've been investigating the other chaos incidents.

**If players examine the back exit (Notice/Stealth):**

The curtain concealing the back door is tattered purple velvet, probably from the same ruined costume that Wally's wearing. Behind it, the door is held shut by a single rusty latch—easy to open from this side. Beyond, you can see darkness, trees, and what looks like a narrow animal path leading deeper into the woods.

More importantly, there are muddy prints on the floor near the door—boot prints (human-sized, Wally's presumably) and something else. Paw prints. Feline, but oddly perfect, like the ones you might have seen at the clearing's edge. They overlap Wally's tracks, suggesting someone else was here recently, someone who came and went and left no trace outside. A visitor? A collaborator?

**If players try to disrupt Wally without direct confrontation (Create Advantage with environment):**

The flash paper catches your eye. It's stored in a metal tin marked with fire hazard warnings, sitting dangerously close to an old oil lamp that's somehow still lit despite the chaos. If you could knock that lamp over—carefully—the flash would be spectacular: a burst of light and sound, completely harmless but shocking. Wally might drop the flute in surprise, or at least break his concentration long enough for the spell to weaken.

Alternatively, the shack's support beam nearest you is cracked and looks like it's held together mostly by prayer and a few bent nails. A good solid hit—maybe using your weight, or by pulling down one of the heavier boxes stacked against it—could cause a partial collapse. Nothing life-threatening, but definitely enough to send Wally scrambling and create chaos you could exploit.

Or there's the fog machine. It's old, battery-powered, and probably doesn't work anymore. But then again... [If a player tinkers with it, they might discover it still has a little juice left. Triggering it would fill the shack with dense, theatrical fog, cutting visibility to almost nothing and forcing everyone to act blind.]

**If players confront Wally directly (social or physical conflict):**

If you call out to Wally, try to reason with him, or simply attack, he *will* notice you. His eyes snap open, focusing with manic intensity.

"Cats!" he shrieks, voice high and cracking. "You're not part of the show! You're supposed to be in the AUDIENCE! Get back, get back!" He swings the flute like a weapon, and the music becomes discordant, aggressive. The air around him shimmers with force—not enough to seriously hurt someone your size, but enough to knock you back if you're not braced.

If you can match his energy—out-crazy the crazy, perhaps, or appeal to his damaged ego ("You're better than this trick! A REAL magician wouldn't need to enslave his audience!")—he might falter. His greatest desire is recognition, validation. His greatest fear is being called a hack. Either could be leveraged.

But if the fight goes badly, he'll absolutely try to turn the flute on you directly, attempting to add you to the mindless horde outside.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Flimsy Shack
*   Boxes of 'Magic' Supplies
*   Deafening, Discordant Music

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Wally, the Pied Piper:** Delighted by the chaos he is creating.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players manage to disarm Wally, either by taking the flute, breaking it, or otherwise silencing its magic. The animals slowly begin to come to their senses, and Wally flees in the confusion.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They stop the music, but not before Wally uses the chaos to create a significant complication, like starting a fire in the shack or causing a stampede in a dangerous direction.
*   **Failure:** Wally escapes with his flute intact, leaving the players to deal with a massive, confused, and now very angry mob of wild and domestic animals.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Disarm the Music:** Overcome with Fight/Athletics/Deceive to separate Wally from the flute or block airflow (cloth, water, jam the mouthpiece).
  - **Drown the Sound:** Create Advantage with Crafts/Lore to set up counter-noise, insulation, or disrupt acoustics (topple shelves, thick curtains, foam).
  - **Turn the Crowd:** Create Advantage with Rapport/Provoke to rally calmer animals to form a living barrier.
  - **Trap the Piper:** Overcome with Crafts/Notice to rig nets/cords; free invoke on "Tangled in Props".

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Cracked Reagent Vial** (Investigate): Alchemical residue that amplifies sound; smashing it weakens the flute.
  - **False Bottom in Trunk** (Notice/Crafts): Holds show notes mapping performances to recent incidents (breadcrumb to orchestrated chaos, Act 2 links).
  - **Back Exit to Alley** (Notice): Route for chase or ambush.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Stage notes mention a "zoo gig" with a contact named "R" (points to Ra).
  - Receipt from a hardware store for specialized wrench (ties to hydrant scene).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Wally escapes but drops the flute’s reed or silver inlay (usable as anti-shifter clue later).
  - The shack catches fire creating a scene aspect **Smoke and Sparks**, complicating retreat but revealing the hidden trunk.

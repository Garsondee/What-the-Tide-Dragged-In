# Act 0, Scene 2: The Dark Woods

**Central Question:** Can the players gain passage through the magically protected Lynx territory with their dog companion?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

The path to the Darkwoods narrows as you leave the familiar streets and alleyways of Silverfield behind. The transition is abrupt—one moment you're padding along cracked pavement under streetlamps, the next you're stepping onto soft earth beneath a canopy so thick it swallows the twilight whole. The air changes immediately: cooler, heavier, laced with the sharp green scent of ancient pines and something else—something that makes your whiskers tingle and your hackles want to rise. Magic. Old magic, woven into the roots and boughs.

The trees here are giants, their trunks wider than any human car, their branches creating layers of shadow upon shadow. Moss hangs in thick curtains from the limbs, and the undergrowth is a tangle of ferns and twisted roots that seem to shift subtly when you're not looking directly at them. The forest floor is carpeted in pine needles that muffle your pawsteps, but every snap of twig or rustle of leaf echoes strangely, as if the woods themselves are listening.

Sappho pads beside you, her usual bravado tempered by unease. Her ears swivel constantly, tracking sounds you can't quite hear. "The Slynx don't take kindly to trespassers," she murmurs, voice low. "Especially not dogs. These woods have been their territory for generations, and they've kept it that way with wards and warnings."

Ahead, the path—if it can even be called that—leads deeper into darkness. But before you can take more than a few steps, you hear it: a low, resonant growl that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Then, movement.

A massive lynx emerges from between the trees, stepping into what little light filters through the canopy. This is Big Lynx, elder of the Slynx clan, and their size and bearing make it clear why they hold that title. Their coat is thick and silvered with age, tufted ears standing tall, eyes like pale amber coins that fix on your group with an intensity that feels like physical weight. They move with deliberate slowness, each pawstep placed with absolute certainty, blocking the path forward.

"Cats of Silverfield," Big Lynx's voice is a low rumble, formal and edged with suspicion. "And... a dog." Their gaze locks onto Sappho, who lowers her head respectfully but doesn't break eye contact. "You stand at the threshold of the Darkwoods. This is Slynx land, protected by ancient compact and older magic. State your business, quickly and truthfully. We have little patience for outsiders, and none at all for those who bring the stink of human-touched shores and sea-spray into our sacred groves."

Behind Big Lynx, you catch a glimpse of another figure—younger, sleeker, with a coat that seems to shimmer between patterns in the dappled light. Jewels, perhaps? The younger lynx watches with open curiosity, though they say nothing, deferring to their elder.

The forest around you feels alive, waiting. You can sense invisible eyes in the shadows, hear the faintest whisper of movement in the undergrowth. This isn't just a border checkpoint—it's a test.

What draws your attention:
- **The Ward-Stones:** Half-hidden beneath moss and ferns, you can make out carved stones arranged in a rough circle around this clearing. They hum with a faint, subsonic vibration.
- **The Body Language:** Big Lynx's stance is defensive, territorial, but there's something else in their eyes—worry? Fear? They're not just being territorial for tradition's sake.
- **The Paths:** Multiple game trails branch off from this spot, winding deeper into the woods. Some look well-traveled; others are overgrown, as if deliberately obscured.
- **Sappho's Urgency:** The dog is practically vibrating with the need to press forward, but she's smart enough to know that forcing the issue will end badly.

How do you win passage? Or will you need to find another way?

## As the Scene Unfolds

**If players examine the ward-stones (Lore/Warding/Notice):**

Kneeling—or rather, crouching low—near one of the stones, you can see it more clearly. It's old, older than Silverfield itself, carved with spiraling glyphs that hurt to look at directly. The stone thrums beneath your paw when you touch it, a steady pulse like a heartbeat. There's power here, but it's strained somehow, like a rope pulled too tight. The pattern of the wards should form a perfect circle, but one stone is dark, its glow extinguished. 

If you know anything about magical defenses, you realize this: the wards aren't just keeping intruders out. They're keeping something in. Or they were, until recently. The broken stone suggests the barrier has been compromised.

**If players appeal to Big Lynx with evidence or logic (Rapport/Will/Investigate):**

When you present the agenda notes from the parliament, or speak of the disappearances with genuine concern, Big Lynx's expression shifts—barely, but noticeably. The elder lynx exchanges a glance with Jewels, and some silent communication passes between them.

"You know, then," Big Lynx says quietly, almost to themselves. "Or you suspect." They pad closer, lowering their voice so only your group can hear. "Three nights past, we found signs at the eastern boundary—paw prints that appeared and vanished mid-stride, strange scents that shift and change. And the animals... we've heard the song. A flute, played in the deep woods where no human should be. Those who hear it wander toward it, entranced. We've lost two of our own cubs. They walked into the trees and did not return."

The admission clearly costs the elder pride, but there's desperation beneath the formality. "If you truly mean to investigate, if you can stop whatever darkness has taken root here... then perhaps an exception can be made. But the dog stays."

Sappho's ears flatten, but before she can protest, Jewels steps forward. "Elder," the younger lynx says carefully, "what if their need is as great as ours? What if the dog has lost someone too?"

**If players notice the scent on the wind (Notice, especially with keen senses):**

Beneath the pine and moss, beneath even the musk of lynx territory, there's something else. It takes a moment to place—a faint trace of wet dog, yes, but also something sharper, more chemical. Soap? Cleaning solution? The unmistakable tang of the pound, of cages and concrete and fear. Someone or something passed through here recently that had been near the Animal Control facility. The trail leads deeper into the woods, toward where the flute music supposedly originates.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Dark Shadows & Lofty Boughs
*   Smells of Ancient Magic
*   Tree-Choppers Aren't Welcome

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Big Lynx (BL):** A territorial and suspicious elder of the Slynx clan.
*   **Jewels:** A young, curious, and more open-minded lynx.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players successfully appeal to the lynx's sense of duty or curiosity. Jewels is assigned to guide them, seeing the wisdom in investigating the strange events.
*   **Success with a Cost:** The players gain passage, but only after making a difficult promise to Big Lynx, or by leaving Sappho behind temporarily, forcing them to retrieve him later.
*   **Failure:** The players fail to convince Big Lynx. They must either try to sneak through the woods (a dangerous proposition) or retreat and find another way to track the missing animals. Jewels might offer help secretly later.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Win the Gate:** Overcome with Rapport/Provoke/Will vs Big Lynx to gain formal passage; Create Advantage with Empathy to read what BL values (duty, proof of threat).
  - **Prove the Threat:** Create Advantage with Investigate/Lore by producing signs from Scene 1 (agenda notes, witness details) to sway BL.
  - **Offer a Vow:** Create Advantage with Rapport/Contacts to promise a service (e.g., return a lost cub’s token), establishing a future compel.
  - **Bypass the Gate:** Sneak (Stealth/Athletics) along canopy paths; success reveals a shortcut aspect usable later.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Old Ward-Stones Humming** (discover with Lore/Warding): Suggests the Speaking Stone’s magic resonates here.
  - **Dog-Scent on the Wind** (Notice): Foreshadows pound direction; ties to Act 3.
  - **Jewels’ Curious Glance** (Empathy): Free invoke to "Secret Ally" if treated kindly.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - BL mentions strange tools found at forest edge (points to human interference; later hydrant/zoo signs).
  - Jewels hints a song in the trees at night (Wally/shapeshifter interference).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Refused entry, but Jewels slips them a bark-twig token that lets them track her (invoke later for guidance).
  - Passage granted only if Sappho waits outside; create aspect **Separated from Sappho** for later tension and reunite at the pound.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - BL’s pride to demand a public concession from PCs.
  - Any PC Trouble about dogs vs cats to spark inter-party friction at the gate.

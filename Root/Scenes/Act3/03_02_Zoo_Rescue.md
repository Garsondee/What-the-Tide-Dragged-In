# Act 3, Scene 2: The Zoo of Chaos

**Central Question:** Can the players rescue Jewels while also preventing the shapeshifters from causing a catastrophe?

**Situation Aspects:**
*   **Under Construction:** The zoo is a maze of half-finished enclosures and scattered building materials.
*   **Rampaging Excavator:** A piece of construction equipment has gone haywire, threatening animals and players alike.
*   **The Shell Game:** Mehitabel and Ra are hiding in plain sight, disguised as one of the zoo's many feline inhabitants.
*   **Panicked Animals:** The zoo's residents are terrified and unpredictable.

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Jewels:** Held in the veterinary clinic, groggy but aware of the danger.
*   **The REAL Mystic Mogg:** Tied up and hidden in the clinic.
*   **Mehitabel & Ra:** In disguise, orchestrating the chaos from within.
*   **Zoo Staff:** Trying desperately to contain the disaster.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **Jewels (in Lynx-Conlang, upon seeing the players):** "It's a trap! They are not what they seem! One is among you!"

**GM Note (The Reveal):**
When the players find Jewels, they also find the real, bound Mystic Mogg. This is the moment of the big reveal, where "Mogg" (Ra) can no longer maintain the deception.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players rescue Jewels and the real Mystic Mogg, leading to the dramatic reveal of Ra's deception. They secure **another piece of the Speaking Stone** that Jewels had hidden.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They rescue Jewels, but the machinery causes significant damage, or an innocent animal is hurt, adding a complication to the final act.
*   **Failure:** The players are forced to retreat, leaving Jewels behind for now. The shapeshifters have proven they can create chaos on a massive scale, raising the stakes for the final confrontation.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Control the Machine:** Crafts/Lore to disable or redirect the excavator; aspects "Emergency Stop" or "Deadman Switch Braced" with free invokes.
  - **Disguise Detection:** Create Advantage with Investigate/Empathy to spot micro-tells in cat behavior; place "Mask Slips" to unmask a shifter.
  - **Zone Safety:** Overcome with Athletics/Notice to clear paths and pen panicked animals; place "Safe Corridor".
  - **Split Ops:** Run a two-prong plan—one team to clinic (stealth), one to machinery (control). Offer cross-scene boosts when timed.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Toolbox with Missing Keys** (Investigate): Suggests inside help or prior tampering.
  - **Faint Silver Smear** (Lore): On clinic doorframe; ties to silver tag lore.
  - **Keeper’s Radio Chatter** (Notice): Reveals staff positions and a momentary blind spot.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Vet notes mention unusual sedation protocols requested by an external "consultant" (points to shifters’ manipulation).
  - A zoo map with a maintenance tunnel to the amphitheater—future staging ground.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Machinery causes collateral damage; create consequence **Public Outcry Building** for the Epilogue.
  - Rescue only one (Jewels or Mogg) now; the other requires a short follow-up micro-scene or bargain with staff.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC compassion compels to save an endangered non-target animal first.
  - Ra taunts through a PC’s belief or bond, provoking risky pursuit.

# Act 3, Scene 1: The Pound Rescue

**Central Question:** How will the players break Sappho out of the Animal Control pound?

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Cold, Sterile Cages
*   Humans in Uniform
*   The Howling of the Damned

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Sappho:** Trapped, scared, but defiant.
*   **Animal Control Officers:** Professional, but not expecting a coordinated jailbreak from cats.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **Sappho (in Dog-Conlang, upon seeing the players):** "You came! They were not cats... they wore faces of friends..."
*   **Other Dogs (in Dog-Conlang):** A cacophony of barks: "Freedom!" "Out!" "Who are you?"

**GM Note (The Abduction):**
This scene is the ideal place for Mystic Mogg to be separated from the group and replaced by Ra. Mogg might volunteer for a solo diversion or get cut off during the escape. When "Mogg" rejoins the party, it is secretly Ra in disguise.

**Optional Objective: The Silver Tag**
If the players understood the Slynx Shaman's warning, they have a secondary objective: infiltrate the main Animal Control office to steal a **specialized silver animal tag**. This is a high-risk detour.
*   **The Office:** This area is brightly lit, likely occupied by a human, and breaking in requires a high degree of stealth or a very effective distraction.
*   **The Reward:** If they succeed, they gain the aspect **Silver Anti-Shapeshifter Tag**, a powerful tool for the final confrontation.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** A stealthy infiltration, a loud distraction, or a full-on assault. Success means Sappho is freed, and the players recover **another piece of the Speaking Stone** she was guarding. If they attempted the optional objective, they may also escape with the silver tag.
*   **Failure:** The rescue fails, and the players are forced to retreat. Failure during the optional objective will almost certainly alert all the Animal Control Officers, putting the main rescue in jeopardy.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Infiltration Routes:** Create Advantage with Stealth/Crafts to map vents, roof hatches, and kennel keys; add "Quiet Path" and "Borrowed Keyring" with free invokes.
  - **Distraction Play:** Provoke/Rapport to trigger a kennel chorus or staged commotion; boost "All Eyes on Aisle 3".
  - **Human Systems:** Lore/Investigate to manipulate door magnets, motion sensors, and logs; place "Timed Unlocks".
  - **Dog Solidarity:** Rapport/Empathy to coordinate with friendly dogs for a coordinated howl or cage bump chain that shifts zones.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Rotating Patrol Pattern** (Notice): A predictable gap every few minutes.
  - **Silver Tag Location** (Investigate): On a hookboard in the office; discover via clipboard inventory or reflected glint.
  - **Scent of a Cat** (Notice): Minute traces in staff area; foreshadows a prior shifter visit.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Intake notes reference animals from the zoo, cross-listing enclosure numbers.
  - A misplaced requisition form for silver tags stamped with a vendor used by the zoo contractor.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Alarm trips, but PCs still free Sappho; they escape with a consequence and a pursuit clock.
  - They miss the tag but learn the vendor and get a map to the office for a later return.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC loyalty to free other dogs, stretching time and risking exposure.
  - Sapphoâ€™s pride to attempt a bold escape move that changes the plan mid-run.

# Act 3, Scene 1: The Pound Rescue

**Central Question:** How will the players break Sappho out of the Animal Control pound?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

The Animal Control building looms before you, all concrete and chain-link fence.

**From a Cat's Perspective:**

The smell hits you first, even from outside: disinfectant so strong it burns your nose, mixed with fear-sweat from dozens of trapped animals, urine, bleach, and underneath it all, despair. It's a place where animals go and sometimes don't come back. Every instinct screams at you to run.

As you slip inside through a vent, the sounds assault you. Dogs barking, howling, whimpering—some in rage, some in terror, some just calling hopelessly for their humans. Cats yowling. The mechanical hum of fluorescent lights buzzing at a frequency that makes your teeth ache. Metal doors clanging. Human voices, loud and echoing off tile walls.

The floor is cold linoleum under your paws, slick and chemical-smelling. Everything is hard surfaces—no soft places, no warmth. The lights are too bright, washing out shadows, leaving nowhere to hide. The cages are arranged in rows, each one a metal box with bars. You can see Sappho in one, her normally proud posture diminished, looking smaller in the harsh light.

The humans wear uniforms—thick boots that stomp, jingling keys, the crackle of radios. They move with authority through this terrible place, and you're just a small cat. If they catch you, you'll end up in one of those cages too. The thought makes your heart race.

The air is wrong here. Recycled, stale, too cold. And beneath everything, you catch that scent again: cat, but *wrong*. Someone else has been here. Recently.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Cold, Sterile Cages
*   Humans in Uniform
*   The Howling of the Damned (constant, terrified animal sounds)
*   Everything Smells of Bleach and Fear
*   Nowhere to Hide (bright lights, hard surfaces, open spaces)
*   The Wrong Cat Scent (faint but present)

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Sappho:** Trapped, scared, but defiant.
*   **Animal Control Officers:** Professional, but not expecting a coordinated jailbreak from cats.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **Sappho (in Dog-Conlang, upon seeing the players):** "You came! They were not cats... they wore faces of friends..."
*   **Other Dogs (in Dog-Conlang):** A cacophony of barks: "Freedom!" "Out!" "Who are you?"

**GM Note (The Abduction):**
This scene is the ideal place for Mystic Mogg to be separated from the group and replaced by Ra. Mogg might volunteer for a solo diversion or get cut off during the escape. When "Mogg" rejoins the party, it is secretly Ra in disguise.

**Optional Objective: The Silver Tag**
If the players understood the Lynx Shaman's warning, they have a secondary objective: infiltrate the main Animal Control office to steal a **specialized silver animal tag**. This is a high-risk detour.
*   **The Office:** This area is brightly lit, likely occupied by a human, and breaking in requires a high degree of stealth or a very effective distraction.
*   **The Reward:** If they succeed, they gain the aspect **Silver Anti-Shapeshifter Tag**, a powerful tool for the final confrontation.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** A stealthy infiltration, a loud distraction, or a full-on assault. Success means Sappho is freed, and the players recover **another shell fragment of the Speaking Stone** she was guarding. She had hidden it in her collar when the shapeshifters ambushed them. If they attempted the optional objective, they may also escape with the silver tag.
*   **Failure:** The rescue fails, and the players are forced to retreat. Failure during the optional objective will almost certainly alert all the Animal Control Officers, putting the main rescue in jeopardy.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Infiltration Routes:** Create Advantage with Stealth/Crafts to map vents, roof hatches, and kennel keys; add "Quiet Path" and "Borrowed Keyring" with free invokes.
  - **Distraction Play:** Provoke/Rapport to trigger a kennel chorus or staged commotion; boost "All Eyes on Aisle 3".
  - **Human Systems:** Lore/Investigate to manipulate door magnets, motion sensors, and logs; place "Timed Unlocks".
  - **Dog Solidarity:** Rapport/Empathy to coordinate with friendly dogs for a coordinated howl or cage bump chain that shifts zones.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Rotating Patrol Pattern** (Notice): A predictable gap every few minutes.
  - **Silver Tag Location** (Investigate): On a hookboard in the office; discover via clipboard inventory or reflected glint.
  - **Scent of a Cat** (Notice): Minute traces in staff area; foreshadows a prior shifter visit.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Intake notes reference animals from the zoo, cross-listing enclosure numbers.
  - A misplaced requisition form for silver tags stamped with a vendor used by the zoo contractor.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Alarm trips, but PCs still free Sappho; they escape with a consequence and a pursuit clock.
  - They miss the tag but learn the vendor and get a map to the office for a later return.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC loyalty to free other dogs, stretching time and risking exposure.
  - Sappho’s pride to attempt a bold escape move that changes the plan mid-run.

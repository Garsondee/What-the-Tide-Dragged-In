# Act 3, Scene 3: A United Front

**Central Question:** Can the newly forged alliance defeat the shapeshifters and secure the future of Silverfield?

**Situation Aspects:**
*   **The Speaking Stone, Mended:** Communication is restored, and with it, a wave of new consciousness.
*   **An Army of the Awakened:** The zoo animals are now sentient, angry, and ready to defend their home.
*   **Cornered and Desperate:** The shapeshifters have nowhere left to run and are lashing out with everything they have.

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Mehitabel & Ra:** Fighting for their freedom, their plans in ashes.
*   **Sappho & Jewels:** Standing together, a symbol of the new unity.
*   **The United Army:** A massive force of cats, dogs, lynx, and enraged zoo animals (represented as a single group with a high skill for overcoming obstacles).

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The shapeshifters are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and righteous fury of the united army. They are captured, not killed, and taken away to face justice. Upon their defeat, the players recover **any remaining shell fragments of the Speaking Stone** from them (the shapeshifters had been keeping these as "insurance"). With all 11 shell fragments now gathered and the jade heart stone from Jewels, the Speaking Stone can be fully restored. The alliance is solidified, and the players are hailed as heroes.
*   **Success with a Cost:** The shapeshifters are captured, but not before one of them lands a significant blow on a key NPC, or reveals a disturbing piece of information about a new threat on the horizon, leaving a hook for the next adventure.

**GM Note (The Silver Tag):**
If the players acquired the **Silver Anti-Shapeshifter Tag**, they can attempt to use it in this conflict. A successful Overcome roll against the shapeshifter's Physique will attach the tag. A tagged shapeshifter cannot use their **A Thousand Faces** or **Gremlin in the Machine** stunts and can no longer spend Fate points to alter their physical form. This makes them significantly easier to defeat.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Tag the Shifter:** Overcome with Athletics/Fight/Notice teamwork to attach the Silver Tag; on success, place "Tagged!" shutting down disguise/machinery stunts.
  - **Command the Field:** Create Advantage with Provoke/Rapport to coordinate the United Army; aspects like "Encirclement" or "Volley of Distractors".
  - **Exploit Terrain:** Crafts/Athletics to topple barriers, funnel foes; add "Choke Point" or "High Ground Overlook".
  - **Expose the Lie:** Investigate/Empathy to call out shifter tells mid-fight, compelling a mistake.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Cracking Resolve** (Empathy): Mehitabel doubts the endgame—press for concession.
  - **Unstable Power Source** (Lore/Crafts): A device the shifters rely on runs hot; disabling causes a stunt to fizzle.
  - **Fractured Allegiances** (Rapport): Some animals hesitate; flip them with a stirring appeal.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - A coded note on Ra hints at outside patrons beyond Silverfield (hooks next arc).
  - Fragments of altered documents referencing zoo contracts and an unknown sigil.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - PCs win but at a severe cost: a key ally takes a consequence that colors the Epilogue.
  - Shifters escape but drop evidence and lose face; alliance still forms, trial postponed.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC mercy compels to accept surrender and shift to social victory conditions.
  - Enemy desperation compels collateral damage unless contained, forcing hard choices.

## The Villain Reveal

**When to Use This:** At a dramatic moment during the confrontation—either when the shapeshifters are first cornered, or after the players land a significant blow. This works best if the players have already pieced together most of the plot, turning the monologue into confirmation rather than exposition dump. Use Mehitabel and Ra's dialogue to add flavor and emotional weight to the final battle.

### Mehitabel's Confession

Mehitabel's voice cuts through the chaos, sharp with bitter fury:

*"You want to know why? You really want to know why I'd tear this precious alliance apart?"*

She circles, hackles raised, eyes blazing with a year's worth of resentment.

*"A year ago, you 'heroes' chased us through that rotting lobster theme park. Remember? You probably thought it was all very exciting—a grand adventure, a thrilling chase. Well, here's what you didn't stick around to see:"*

*"That Ferris wheel you knocked loose? It rolled. And rolled. And rolled right through the only home the Feral Cats had left. Crushed our dens. Scattered our supplies. Destroyed the one place in this entire town where we belonged."*

Her tail lashes like a whip.

*"And then it rolled into the sea, taking half our territory with it. We lost everything that night. Not just the fight—everything. Our pride. Our place. Our future. While you celebrated your victory, we picked through rubble."*

*"The Cat Parliament didn't even notice. Too busy making new friends—dogs! Lynx! As if you needed more allies. As if we weren't still here, still bleeding from what you'd done. You built your precious peace on the bones of our home, and you never even looked back."*

### Ra's Introduction

If Mehitabel is the fury, Ra is the cold calculation. They speak with an almost theatrical calm:

*"Me? Oh, I'm no one. Just another displaced soul. A shapeshifter, like Mehitabel—though I prefer to think of myself as an artist. I've been... between homes for some time now. Zoos, mostly. They're wonderful places to disappear, you know. So many faces to wear, so many identities to slip into."*

They shift slightly, their form rippling for just a moment before settling.

*"I was enjoying a quiet residency at Silverfield's charming little zoo when I met our dear Mehitabel. She came to the fence one night, looking for a way out of this town. We got to talking. Shared stories. Shared grievances."*

A small, dangerous smile.

*"She told me about the theme park. About the wheel. About you. And I told her about the Speaking Stone—how deliciously fragile it is, how much chaos its breaking would cause. We realized we wanted the same thing: to watch your perfect little alliance crumble. To prove that your peace was built on sand."*

*"So we made a plan. Frame the lovers. Shatter communication. Let suspicion and fear do the rest. Simple, elegant, and so very satisfying."*

### The Joint Explanation (If Needed)

If the players still seem confused, Ra can deliver a more explicit recap with dark amusement:

*"Let me spell it out, since you seem determined to play dumb: We ambushed your precious Sappho and Jewels at their trysting spot. Broke the Speaking Stone right in front of them. Let the humans scoop them up while the Speaking Stone's magic died."*

*"We knew the dogs and lynx would blame each other once they couldn't talk. We knew you'd scramble to fix it. And we knew that by the time you figured it out, we'd have already torn your alliance to shreds."*

Mehitabel adds, voice hard:

*"We would have ruled the ashes. Built something new from the wreckage. Something that didn't leave cats like us behind."*

### GM Tips for Delivery

- **Let Players Interrupt:** If players want to argue, challenge, or attack during the monologue, let them. The villains can deliver their lines in pieces, between exchanges.
- **Adjust Tone:** If players already figured out the plot, have Mehitabel and Ra acknowledge it: *"Oh, you worked it out? Clever. But understanding and stopping us are two different things."*
- **Add Regret (Optional):** For groups that might want a redemption arc, let Mehitabel's voice crack slightly when talking about the destroyed home, showing genuine pain beneath the rage.
- **Keep Ra Enigmatic:** Ra should remain somewhat mysterious—their past, their true motivations, and their "outside patrons" can seed future adventures.

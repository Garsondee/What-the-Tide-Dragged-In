# Act 2, Scene 4: The Catnip Calamity

**Central Question:** Can the players uncover the truth when a massive bag of potent, high-grade catnip splits open in the town square, implicating the Cat Parliament in a public nuisance?

**Situation Aspects:**
*   The Air is Thick with 'Nip
*   Cats Rolling in Ecstasy
*   Accusatory Glares from Humans
*   A Torn Bag with a Strange Symbol

**Key NPCs:**
*   **The Town Mayor:** Furious and demanding answers.
*   **A Blissed-Out Slynx:** Rolling around in the catnip, lost to the world.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **The Slynx (in Lynx-Conlang, between purrs):** "The... the sky... it's made of nip... I saw a cat with a wicked smile drop the bag..."

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players manage to clean up the mess and placate the mayor. They get a clear description of the culprit from the Slynx: a cat not from any known faction, with a cruel smile. They also notice the bag is marked with a symbol they recognize from the zoo. The players now have enough evidence to know the chaos is orchestrated and originates from the zoo.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They handle the situation, but the Cat Parliament's reputation is tarnished. The other factions now look at them with suspicion.
*   **Failure:** The Cat Parliament is officially blamed for the incident. The players now have a town-wide complication, **Public Nuisance**, that can be invoked against them.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Contain the Scene:** Create Advantage with Crafts/Athletics to cordon off the square, wet down the nip, or sweep paths; place "Managed Perimeter".
  - **Soothe or Rouse:** Rapport/Provoke to calm dazzled cats or rally helpers; Will to resist the nip aura.
  - **Question Witnesses:** Investigate/Empathy with the blissed-out Slynx and bystanders for a composite description.
  - **Symbol Forensics:** Lore/Notice to identify the symbol and supply chain link to the zoo.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Oil-Infused Blend** (Lore): Enhanced potency; indicates expert preparation.
  - **Torn Seam, Clean Cut** (Investigate): Bag was sliced, not burst.
  - **Security Cam Above Deli** (Notice): Has partial view; angle suggests someone knew blind spots.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Sticker inside the bag from zoo supplier.
  - Eyewitness mentions a cat with a perfect but uncanny smile (points to Ra/Mehitabel).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Public Nuisance aspect attaches, but the PCs get two solid clues (symbol + witness sketch).
  - The Mayor imposes a timetable: resolve within a day or sanctions hit the Parliament.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC Trouble about temptation to sample the nip; impose a short-term aspect.
  - The Mayorâ€™s image obsession derails the investigation unless appeased.

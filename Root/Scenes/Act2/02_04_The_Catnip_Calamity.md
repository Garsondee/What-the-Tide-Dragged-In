# Act 2, Scene 4: The Catnip Calamity

**Central Question:** Can the players uncover the truth when a massive bag of potent, high-grade catnip splits open in the town square, implicating the Cat Parliament in a public nuisance?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

The town square smells like heaven. Or maybe hell. It's hard to tell.

**From a Cat's Perspective:**

The scent hits you like a physical wave—*catnip*. Not the mild stuff from a toy mouse. This is *premium*, oil-infused, impossibly potent catnip. The smell fills your nose, your mouth, your entire head. It's intoxicating, overwhelming, making your pupils dilate and your claws extend involuntarily. Every instinct screams at you to roll in it, to rub your face in it, to lose yourself in the euphoria.

You have to dig your claws into the cobblestones just to stay upright. Focus. Focus. But the air is *thick* with it—a green-brown cloud of powdered bliss hanging over the square like fog. You can taste it on your tongue, minty and bitter-sweet, making you want to purr despite yourself.

Around you, cats have completely lost it. A distinguished Parliament elder is rolling on her back in the middle of the street, paws batting at nothing. Two alley cats are wrestling playfully, their territorial feud forgotten. Even the usually stoic Slynx is sprawled in the catnip pile, purring so loud you can hear it from here, paws kneading the air.

Humans stand at the edge of the square, some amused, some annoyed, some filming on their phones. The Town Mayor stands with arms crossed, face red with fury. This is *humiliating*. This makes your whole species look like addicts.

And underneath the overwhelming scent of catnip, if you can focus through the haze, there's something else: the faint chemical smell of the torn bag's plastic, and a scent that doesn't belong. Cat, but... wrong.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   The Air is Thick with 'Nip (Will checks to resist; +2 difficulty)
*   Cats Rolling in Ecstasy (deeply embarrassing)
*   Accusatory Glares from Humans (filming everything)
*   A Torn Bag with a Strange Symbol
*   This is PREMIUM Stuff (oil-infused, expert-grade)

**Key NPCs:**
*   **The Town Mayor:** Furious and demanding answers.
*   **A Blissed-Out Slynx:** Rolling around in the catnip, lost to the world.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **The Slynx (in Lynx-Conlang, between purrs):** "The... the sky... it's made of nip... I saw a cat with a wicked smile drop the bag..."

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players manage to clean up the mess and placate the mayor. They get a clear description of the culprit from the Slynx: a cat not from any known faction, with a cruel smile. They also notice the bag is marked with a symbol they recognize from the zoo. The players now have enough evidence to know the chaos is orchestrated and originates from the zoo.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They handle the situation, but the Cat Parliament's reputation is tarnished. The other factions now look at them with suspicion.
*   **Failure:** The Cat Parliament is officially blamed for the incident. The players now have a town-wide complication, **Public Nuisance**, that can be invoked against them.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Contain the Scene:** Create Advantage with Crafts/Athletics to cordon off the square, wet down the nip, or sweep paths; place "Managed Perimeter".
  - **Soothe or Rouse:** Rapport/Provoke to calm dazzled cats or rally helpers; Will to resist the nip aura.
  - **Question Witnesses:** Investigate/Empathy with the blissed-out Slynx and bystanders for a composite description.
  - **Symbol Forensics:** Lore/Notice to identify the symbol and supply chain link to the zoo.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Oil-Infused Blend** (Lore): Enhanced potency; indicates expert preparation.
  - **Torn Seam, Clean Cut** (Investigate): Bag was sliced, not burst.
  - **Security Cam Above Deli** (Notice): Has partial view; angle suggests someone knew blind spots.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Sticker inside the bag from zoo supplier.
  - Eyewitness mentions a cat with a perfect but uncanny smile (points to Ra/Mehitabel).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Public Nuisance aspect attaches, but the PCs get two solid clues (symbol + witness sketch).
  - The Mayor imposes a timetable: resolve within a day or sanctions hit the Parliament.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC Trouble about temptation to sample the nip; impose a short-term aspect.
  - The Mayor’s image obsession derails the investigation unless appeased.

# Act 2, Scene 3: The Hydrant Havoc

**Central Question:** Can the players resolve the turf war erupting between the water-loving dogs and water-hating cats after every fire hydrant on a street opens simultaneously?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

Every fire hydrant on Maple Street has burst open at once, turning the road into a rushing river.

**From a Cat's Perspective:**

*Water.* The street is nothing but *water*. Your worst nightmare. The smell hits you first—chlorine, rust, the metallic tang of old pipes—mixed with the sweet, horrible scent of wet dog. The sound is overwhelming: rushing water, splashing paws, barking laughter. You can hear the hydraulic *hiss* of the hydrants, each one spraying at full pressure, the water hitting pavement with enough force to send vibrations up through your paws.

Your fur prickles with horror. Even standing here, three feet from the nearest stream, you can feel the humidity weighing down your coat. One splash and you'll be *soaked*. The thought makes your stomach clench. Cats aren't meant for this.

The dogs, of course, are in heaven. They leap and bound through the fountains, tongues lolling, tails helicoptering with joy. A golden retriever belly-flops into a puddle the size of a small pond, sending up a wave that makes you leap backward with a hiss. Their scent is everywhere—wet fur, dog joy, salt and sweat. It's disgusting.

Above you, along fire escapes and windowsills, the local alley cats are in full fury. Their yowls of rage need no translation. One bedraggled tabby perches on a third-floor escape, her fur plastered flat, looking like a drowned rat. She's hissing non-stop, eyes fixed on the dogs below.

You pick your way carefully along the edge of a building, paws finding the narrow strip of dry concrete. But the water's rising. Soon there won't be any dry path at all.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   Streets Turned to Rivers
*   Soggy and Furious Cats (stuck on rooftops and fire escapes)
*   Playful, Soaking-Wet Dogs (having the time of their lives)
*   A Wrench Left Behind
*   Everything Reeks of Wet Dog
*   The Water is EVERYWHERE (and rising)

**Key NPCs:**
*   **The Salty Sea Dogs:** Enjoying the impromptu water park.
*   **Local Alley Cats:** Hissing from fire escapes, furious at the flooding.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **A Sea Dog Captain (in Dog-Conlang):** "Hahaha! The street is now a glorious river! A fine day for a swim!"

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players successfully mediate the dispute, perhaps by creating a dry passage for the cats or distracting the dogs with a new game. They find a discarded wrench near one of the hydrants. It's of a strange, foreign make, not the kind a local plumber would use. A character with knowledge of mechanics or human tools might recognize it as specialized equipment.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They stop the fighting, but they have to take a side, angering one of the factions and creating a future social complication.
*   **Failure:** The skirmish escalates into a full-blown, public brawl. The players are caught in the middle, and the incident further damages the already-strained inter-species relations.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Make Dry Lanes:** Create Advantage with Crafts/Athletics to place sandbags, boards, or route water; aspect "Dry Passage" aids cats.
  - **New Game for Dogs:** Rapport/Provoke to redirect play to a single hydrant/park; boost "All Eyes Over There".
  - **Hydrant Forensics:** Investigate/Crafts on the wrench and stems to identify nonstandard tool marks.
  - **Authority or Arbitration:** Will/Rapport to convene a quick parley; place "Temporary Ceasefire".

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Unusual Wrench Teeth** (Investigate): Matches hardware from Piper’s receipt.
  - **Pressure Spike Pattern** (Lore/Crafts): Suggests deliberate timing, not random.
  - **Cat Track to Rooftops** (Notice): Light, agile prints—points to shifter agility.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Engraving on wrench links to a contractor that also bids at the zoo.
  - A soaked map with circles around hydrants close to animal thoroughfares.

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Mediation fails, but both sides accept an escort under protest; create aspect **Walking the Line** for next scene.
  - A scuffle breaks a shop window revealing a clue stash (invoice, zoo contact).

- **Compels to Consider**
  - Dog PCs tempted to play; cat PCs compelled by pride to refuse compromise.

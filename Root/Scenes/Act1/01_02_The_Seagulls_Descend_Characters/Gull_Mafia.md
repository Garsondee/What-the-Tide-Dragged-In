# The Gull Mafia (Mob)

**High Concept:** Coordinated Flock of Food Thieves

**Trouble:** Greedy and Overconfident

**Other Aspects:**
- Dive-Bombers
- Eyes on the Prize
- Scatter at a Shout
- Ancestral Rights to the Harbor (or so they claim)

## Description

The Gull Mafia isn't just a flock—it's an *organization*. These seagulls have perfected the art of coordinated theft over generations, passing down tactics from elder to hatchling. They claim "ancestral rights" to every fish, chip, and lobster that comes through Silverfield Harbor, and they'll fight tooth and beak to defend those rights.

They operate in waves: scouts identify targets, dive-bombers create chaos, and snatchers grab the goods. They communicate through a complex system of shrieks and wing signals. Individual gulls are cowardly, but as a mob they're terrifyingly efficient. Loud noises, sudden movements, and organized resistance can scatter them temporarily—but they always regroup.

## Role in the Story
- **Function:** Antagonist Mob / Comic Relief Threat
- **Motivations:** Steal the catch; defend "their" territory; prove they're the real power at the harbor

## Skills (Mob profile)
- **Good (+3):** Fight (Dive & Snatch)
- **Fair (+2):** Create Advantage (Distraction, Feint)
- **Average (+1):** Overcome (Carry Off Loot)

## Stunts
- **Swarming Dives:** +2 to Create Advantage when harrying a single target as a flock. The victim is overwhelmed by wings, beaks, and screeching.
- **Snatch and Scatter:** Once per scene, the Gull Mafia can automatically steal one undefended object (like a lobster crate) without a roll if the PCs are distracted by another threat. The gulls then scatter, forcing the PCs to choose: pursue the thieves or deal with the remaining chaos.
- **The Mob Mentality:** Individual gulls are cowards, but the mob is fearless. If the mob takes a consequence, describe it as the flock fragmenting—individual gulls fleeing in panic, reducing their numbers and coordination.

## Stress (Mob)
- **Group Stress:** [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

## GM Notes
- **Play them as both threatening and ridiculous:** They're dangerous in numbers but individually pathetic. A well-placed shout or thrown object should scatter a dozen at once, only for them to regroup moments later.
- **Use the environment:** Gulls can perch on masts, dive from rooftops, and create moving walls of feathers. They can't easily follow targets into enclosed spaces.
- **Narrative escalation:** Start with small skirmishes (3-5 gulls), then escalate to full swarm tactics (dozens) when the PCs seem to be winning.
- **Defeat doesn't mean death:** "Defeating" the mob means scattering them so thoroughly they give up and retreat. Individual gulls might be hurt but the flock survives to steal another day.

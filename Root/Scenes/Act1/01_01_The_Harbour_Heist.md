# Act 1, Scene 1: The Harbour Heist

**Central Question:** Can the players, as the muscle, fend off the Seagull Mafia long enough for the getaway team to secure the feast's main course?

## Read-Aloud: Opening

After the chaos of Wally's madness in the Darkwoods, the Cat Parliament convened an emergency session. The animals you rescued—dogs, lynx, and cats alike—had all fallen victim to the same enemy: shapeshifters working to destabilize Silverfield's fragile peace. In the aftermath, an idea took root: if the factions could work together against a common threat, perhaps they could work together for a common celebration.

The annual Feast of the Speaking Stone was already planned—a tradition celebrating the magical artifact that allows all species to understand one another. But this year, the Parliament extended an invitation to the Sea Dogs and the Slynx clan to participate not just as guests, but as partners. Together, you would gather a bounty of fish and lobster from the harbor, then party into the night under the full moon, cementing this new alliance with food, drink, and revelry.

The plans have been in motion for days. Everyone has a role. The Sea Dogs bring their knowledge of the tides and fishing boats. The Slynx provide their stealth and coordination. And the Cat Parliament—you—provide the muscle to defend the operation from the one faction guaranteed to object: the Seagull Mafia, who have claimed "ancestral rights" to the harbor's catch since time immemorial.

You've been briefed on the plan. Sappho, the piratical Labrador, and Jewels, the spiritual lynx, will act as the getaway team—their job is to secure the best catches and transport them to the feast site. The rest of the allied dogs and lynx will assist with crowd control and logistics. Your job is simple: keep the gulls busy and off everyone's backs long enough for the operation to succeed.

What nobody mentions—but everyone knows—is that Sappho and Jewels have another reason for volunteering as the getaway team. The two have been conducting a secret romance, forbidden by the strict protocols of their respective clans. Tonight, with a legitimate excuse to slip away early with the "most important cargo," they plan to steal a few precious moments together at their secret trysting spot—a clearing in the woods where the Speaking Stone itself rests in its ancient cradle—before returning to the feast where diplomatic formality will force them to stay apart.

**The Speaking Stone**, that marvel of ancient magic, currently rests in its sacred grove. Thanks to its power, you can understand Sappho's barks and Jewels' lynx-speech as clearly as you understand your fellow cats. The alliance is fragile, yes, but tonight—with communication flowing and good food on the way—it feels like anything is possible.

But first: the heist.

The sun is setting over Silverfield Harbor. The catch is coming in.

**From a Cat's Perspective:**

Your whiskers twitch as the evening breeze carries a thousand scents—salt and seaweed, fish guts and motor oil, and underneath it all, the unfamiliar musk of dog and the wild pine-smell of lynx. The pier timbers creak beneath your paws, rough and splintered, and you can feel the subtle vibrations of heavy human boots thundering across the wooden planks like miniature earthquakes. Each footstep sends tiny tremors up through your sensitive paw pads.

To your left, the fishing boats tower like floating buildings, their hulls looming twice the height of a human, casting long shadows in the orange light. The splash of water against their sides is almost deafening—cats aren't meant for this much noise. The seagulls' cries are pitched at frequencies that make your ears want to flatten against your skull, and the constant *squawk-squawk-squawk* feels like claws raking across your brain.

The lobster crates are massive—each one comes up past your shoulders. You'll have to jump to see inside, and the smell of them makes your mouth water despite yourself. Fresh seafood, brine, the sharp tang of shell and claw. Your stomach rumbles. Focus. You're professionals.

The wood under your paws is still warm from the day's sun, but cooling rapidly. Evening chill creeps into your fur, making you want to fluff up, but that would make you look bigger, more noticeable. Stay sleek. Stay small. The humans tower above like moving buildings, their footsteps making the whole pier shudder with each step.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   The Catch is Coming In
*   Moored Ships and Creaking Ropes
*   Sunset
*   Hungry, Hungry Seagulls
*   Speaking Stone Magic Flows (all species can communicate clearly)
*   Everything Here is Twice Our Height (the boats, crates, and humans loom like giants)
*   A Symphony of Overwhelming Scents (fish, salt, dogs, lynx, humans, gulls—too much!)

**Key NPCs:**
*   **Sappho & Jewels:** The designated getaway team, eager to finish their task so they can sneak away to their secret meeting spot. They work efficiently together, clearly in sync. Sappho uses her powerful jaws and sea-dog strength to grab the heaviest crates while Jewels uses her lynx agility to scout routes and keep watch. They're professional during the heist but occasionally exchange loving glances when they think no one's watching.
*   **Other Sea Dogs and Slynx:** Various members of the allied clans assisting with the operation, managing crowd control and logistics.
*   **Fisherfolk:** Busy, tired, and hostile to any animals near their catch.

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **Sappho (in Dog-Conlang, to Jewels):** "Quickly, my love! To our secret spot!"
*   **Jewels (in Lynx-Conlang, to Sappho):** "Patience, my sea-breeze. The feast first, then us."

**Zones & Spatial Layout:**
*   **Land (Harborfront):** Locals and tourists linger on benches and truck beds, fending gulls from paper-wrapped suppers.
*   **Pierhead (Weighing Area):** Crates of lobsters line up beside battered pickups; buyers weigh, band, record and transfer them to seawater filled boxes.
*   **Wooden Pier (Dockside):** Fisherfolk step from boat to shore, passing dripping totes hand to hand.
*   **Fishing Boats (Waterline):** Lobsters lifted from sloshing wells into crates, claws snapping in protest.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The team executes a perfect heist, securing the lobsters and escaping before the humans are any the wiser. Their new allies, Sappho and Jewels, are deeply impressed.
*   **Success with a Cost:** They get the lobsters, but they make a lot of noise or are spotted. They have to make a run for it as the fisherfolk start shouting and giving chase, drawing unwanted attention.
*   **Failure:** The heist is a disaster. They are spotted early, the humans secure the lobster crates, and the players are forced to flee empty-pawed, with the gulls descending upon them in a frenzy.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Zone Control:** Create Advantage with Athletics/Notice to secure lanes between zones; place improvised barricades (nets, crates) for free invokes.
  - **Bait & Switch:** Deceive/Provoke to lure the gulls to decoy fish guts; on success, add scene boost "Frenzied Dive Away".
  - **Crew Coordination:** Overcome with Rapport/Provoke to synchronize with Sappho & Jewels for timing; grants free invoke on "Clean Getaway" if aligned.
  - **Human Blind Spots:** Create Advantage with Stealth/Crafts to use forklift noise, tarp covers, or floodlights against avians.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Loose Tarp Over Crates** (Notice): Can be turned into a net to trap gulls mid-dive.
  - **Overloaded Winch** (Crafts): One yank could swing a crate to create a moving barrier.
  - **Watchful Harbormaster** (Empathy/Notice): Will intervene if chaos spreads; use to escalate or to gain leverage with a bribe/appeal.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Seagulls chatter about "the breaking of the Voice-Stone" (foreshadows Scene 2 twist).
  - A gull drops a shiny wrench tag stamped with a foreign brand (ties to Hydrant Havoc).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Lose some crates but keep one key lobster box containing a clue (symbol matching later bag in Catnip Calamity).
  - Get spotted by fisherfolk, gaining scene consequence **Faces Remembered** which can be compelled later.

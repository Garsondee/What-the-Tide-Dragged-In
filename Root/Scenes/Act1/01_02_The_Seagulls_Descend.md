# Act 1, Scene 2: The Seagulls Descend

**Central Question:** Can the players defend their stolen feast from the avian onslaught?

---

## Read-Aloud: Opening

Success! You've secured the catch—crates of fresh lobsters, claws snapping indignantly, seawater dripping between the slats. Sappho and Jewels slip away early with the choicest hauls, exchanging a private look before they disappear into the gathering twilight. "We'll take these to the feast site," Sappho calls back, her tail wagging. "You all did great!" The rest of the allied dogs and lynx mill about, helping to organize the remaining catch, everyone still chattering in the shared language the Speaking Stone provides.

But then the sky darkens—not with night, but with wings.

**From a Cat's Perspective:**

The Gull Mafia descends like a feathered storm. Dozens, no, *hundreds* of seagulls, working together with terrifying coordination. The sound is overwhelming—a wall of screeching that hits frequencies only you can hear, piercing and relentless. Every nerve in your body screams *RUN*, but there's nowhere to go.

The air pressure changes as hundreds of wings beat at once. You feel it in your whiskers, in your inner ear—a buffeting, disorienting turbulence that makes it hard to keep your balance. Gulls dive past close enough that their wingtips brush your fur, and each near-miss sends a jolt of adrenaline through your system. You're so *small* compared to them, and they're *everywhere*—above, beside, between.

The lobsters are slippery—wet shells covered in seawater that soaks into your paws, making them cold and awkward. When you try to grip one, it shoots out of your grasp like it's been greased. Claws snap dangerously close to your whiskers. The smell is overwhelming: brine, bird droppings, the acrid scent of gull panic-pheromones. Your ears flatten involuntarily against the cacophony.

**Situation Aspects:**
*   A Sky Black with Gulls
*   Nowhere to Hide
*   The Prize is Slippery! (Invoke to hamper carries; compel to drop a crate at an inopportune moment)

**The Twist:** At the height of the battle with the gulls, you feel it—a sudden, visceral *wrongness* that ripples through the air like thunder without sound. The **Speaking Stone** has been shattered. Somewhere in the woods, far from your eyes, something terrible has happened.

The magical backlash *tastes* like copper and smells like ozone. Your inner ear goes sideways for a moment, and you have to dig your claws into the pier to keep from losing your balance. The vibration you've always felt from the Speaking Stone—that low, comforting hum you never consciously noticed until now—is suddenly, terribly *gone*. It's like losing a whisker you didn't know you had. The world feels... wrong. Incomplete.

A wave of magical energy washes over the docks. In an instant, all inter-species communication is severed. The barks of the Sea Dogs become incomprehensible noise. The yowls of the Slynx turn to gibberish. You can still understand your fellow House Cats perfectly, but everyone else? It's like a wall has slammed down between you.

Panic erupts. The other dogs and lynx involved in the heist fall into disarray, barking and yowling accusations at each other that neither side can understand. "Betrayal!" "Treachery!" They scatter in confusion and fear, the fragile alliance shattered as suddenly as the Stone itself.

And Sappho and Jewels? They're gone. They left minutes ago with the catch, heading to the trysting spot near the Speaking Stone's grove. What happened to them?

**Linguistic Clues:**
*   **A Confused Sea Dog (in incomprehensible Dog-Conlang):** "*Bark bark! Growl-woof bark?! BARK!*" (You can't understand it anymore, but the tone is clear: accusation and fear)
*   **A Panicked Slynx (in incomprehensible Lynx-Conlang):** "*Yowl! Hiss-mrow-yowl!*" (Similarly incomprehensible, but the body language screams panic and rage)

**Note for GM:** Before the Stone breaks, all species can understand each other through its magic. After the break, House Cats can only understand other House Cats. Dog-Conlang and Lynx-Conlang become indecipherable noise. This creates immediate chaos as allies can no longer coordinate.

**Key NPCs:**
*   **The Gull Mafia:** A relentless swarm of seagulls, working together with surprising cunning.

**Potential Outcomes:**
*   **Success:** The players fight off the gulls and manage to keep most of their catch. However, they're left bewildered by the magical catastrophe and the sudden breakdown of the alliance. Their allies scatter in confusion, and Sappho and Jewels have vanished—they were already gone when the Stone broke. Where are they? What happened?
*   **Success with a Cost:** They save a lobster or two, but the gulls make off with the rest. They're left with only a token prize, the chaos of the shattered alliance, and the terrifying mystery of the Stone's destruction and their friends' disappearance.
*   **Failure:** The gulls overwhelm them and steal all the lobsters. The feast is ruined, the alliance is in tatters, and their friends have vanished without a trace. The players must piece together what happened from almost nothing.

## GM Guidance
- **Levers & Buttons**
  - **Smash-and-Grab vs Hold-the-Line:** Let PCs choose; Create Advantage with Athletics/Notice to hold chokepoints, or Deceive to stage decoy hauls.
  - **Environmental Hazards:** Crafts to rig tarps, crates, and ropes; free invokes like "Snare Line" or "Tarp Collapse".
  - **Wrangle the Slippery Prize:** Overcome with Athletics/Physique to maintain grip on lobster crates during the chaos. The Prize is Slippery! can be compelled to force drops or invoked by gulls to snatch crates mid-carry.
  - **Rally Allies (Before the Break):** Rapport to pull bystanders or dogs/cats into aiding; on success add "Momentary Unity" boost. After the Stone breaks, this becomes much harder (increase difficulty by +2) as only House Cats can understand you.
  - **Sense the Wrongness:** Lore/Notice to feel the Stone breaking—a DC 3 passive check. Success means the PC senses something terrible has happened in the direction of the grove, even before the communication fails.

- **Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**
  - **Odd Feather Markings** (Investigate): Paint/scent markers suggest someone directed the gulls. This was a coordinated distraction.
  - **Stone Resonance** (Lore, after the break): Detect lingering magic pointing toward the grove where the Stone rested. The direction of the magical shockwave.
  - **Footprints Toward the Trysting Spot** (Notice): Sappho and Jewels' prints lead away from the docks toward the woods. Following them leads to the Speaking Stone's grove—and evidence of what happened.

- **Breadcrumbs to Pull**
  - Shard of the Speaking Stone glows faintly when near other pieces (mechanical cue for later scenes).
  - A gull carries a ribbon with a zoo logo (points to Act 3 Scene 2).

- **Fail Forward Options**
  - Lose most of the haul but retain a clue (zoo ribbon, foreign wrench tag).
  - The Stone’s break silences inter-species talk, but a PC creates a temporary "Hand Signals" aspect with a free invoke to coordinate.

- **Compels to Consider**
  - PC Trouble about greed or pride to chase gulls into a risky zone.
  - Faction prejudices flare as communication fails; escalate social fallout for future scenes.

# Adventure Timeline

This document outlines the canonical sequence of events for the "What the Tide Dragged In" adventure.

### The Setup (Pre-Adventure)

*   **Mehitabel's Despair:** Following the Feral Cats' disgrace in the "Case of the Greedy Ghost," a bitter Mehitabel is on the verge of leaving Silverfield.
*   **A Fateful Meeting:** She visits the local zoo and meets **Ra**, another shapeshifter who uses their abilities to travel between zoos at will, living a life of quiet containment. They bond over their shared nature and resentment of the established order.
*   **The Plan:** Together, they hatch a plan to shatter the peace in Silverfield. They will break the magical Speaking Stone, which will sever inter-species communication and sow chaos. They plan to frame the dog and lynx communities, incite a war, and rise to power from the resulting anarchy.

### The Heist (Act 1)

*   **The Goal:** The Cat Parliament (the players) is tasked with securing fish/lobster for the anniversary feast. They form a temporary alliance with the Sea Dogs and the Slynx clan for the operation.
*   **The Roles:**
    *   The **Cat Parliament (Players)** act as the muscle, responsible for fighting off the rival **Seagull Mafia** who feel they have a right to the catch.
    *   **Sappho and Jewels** act as the getaway team. Her job is to grab the loot and carry it away. This gives them the perfect excuse to sneak off to their trysting spot—the clearing with the Speaking Stone—before the formal feast where they would be separated by diplomatic protocol.
    *   Other **Sea Dogs and Slynx** are present, assisting with the broader heist operation.
*   **The Twist:** The heist begins well. The players successfully engage the Seagull Mafia while Sappho and Jewels make off with the fish. However, upon arriving at the Speaking Stone clearing, the lovers are ambushed by Mehitabel and Ra. Overburdened with their loot, they are easily overpowered.
*   **The Cataclysm:** At the climax of the heist, the shapeshifters shatter the Speaking Stone. The magical backlash instantly severs communication between all species. While the cats can still understand one another, the languages of the dogs and lynx become gibberish. The heist falls into chaos as the allied dogs and lynx suddenly can't understand each other or the players. They scatter in confusion.

### The Aftermath (Act 2)

*   **False Evidence:** The leaders of the Sea Dogs and Slynx clans arrive at the Speaking Stone clearing to investigate the chaos. They find signs of a struggle and the blood of both a dog and a lynx. Unable to communicate, they leap to the conclusion that they were betrayed by the other faction.
*   **The Players' Investigation:** The players must investigate the disappearance of Sappho and Jewels, leading them to the scene of the crime where they can uncover the truth: their friends were ambushed and dragged away by humans after being left incapacitated.

### The Rescues (Act 3)

*   **The Pound:** The players first stage a rescue for Sappho at the local Animal Control pound, securing one of the lost pieces of the Speaking Stone in the process.
*   **The Zoo & The Shell Game:** The final act takes place at the Silverfield Zoo, which is undergoing renovations. The players must rescue Jewels, who is being held in the veterinary clinic. However, Mehitabel and Ra are hiding among the zoo's feline inhabitants, playing a 'shell game' to confuse and ambush the players.
*   **Rampaging Machinery:** The shapeshifters use their powers to sabotage the construction equipment, turning excavators and bulldozers into rampaging threats, creating chaos and endangering the zoo's inhabitants. The players must simultaneously rescue Jewels and prevent a catastrophe.

### The Climax & Epilogue (Act 4)

*   **A Fragile Reunion:** After a tense chase, the players reunite Sappho and Jewels, recovering the final piece of the Speaking Stone. With all 11 pieces gathered, the Stone is magically mended.
*   **A United Front:** The restored Stone allows Sappho and Jewels to quell the rising tensions between the Sea Dogs and Slynx clan, revealing the shapeshifters' treachery. The animal factions unite. The magic of the reforged stone also awakens full sentience in the surrounding zoo animals, who, enraged at the threat to their home, join the fight.
*   **The Final Battle:** The combined army of Parliament Cats, Sea Dogs, Slynx, and newly-empowered zoo animals confronts the shapeshifters. Overwhelmed, Mehitabel and Ra are defeated and captured, their fate to be decided later.
*   **A New World:** The adventure concludes with the fragile peace between the factions restored and a new social order beginning to form with the addition of dozens of newly sentient species. The shapeshifters' capture leaves a lingering thread for future adventures.

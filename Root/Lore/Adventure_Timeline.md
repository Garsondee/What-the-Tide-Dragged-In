# Adventure Timeline

This document outlines the canonical sequence of events for the "What the Tide Dragged In" adventure.

### The Setup (Pre-Adventure)

*   **Mehitabel's Despair:** Following the Feral Cats' disgrace in the "Case of the Greedy Ghost," a bitter Mehitabel is on the verge of leaving Silverfield.
*   **A Fateful Meeting:** She visits the local zoo and meets **Ra**, another shapeshifter who uses their abilities to travel between zoos at will, living a life of quiet containment. They bond over their shared nature and resentment of the established order.
*   **The Plan:** Together, they hatch a plan to shatter the peace in Silverfield. They know of an ancient standing stone deep in the logging woods—a long-forgotten magical artifact that enables inter-species communication. By destroying it, they will sever communication and sow chaos. They plan to frame the dog and lynx communities, incite a war, and rise to power from the resulting anarchy.

### The Heist (Act 1)

*   **The Goal:** The Cat Parliament (the players) is tasked with securing fish/lobster for the Harvest Feast—an autumn celebration of the season's bounty and the new alliance. They form a temporary alliance with the Sea Dogs and the Lynx clan for the operation.
*   **The Roles:**
    *   The **Cat Parliament (Players)** act as the muscle, responsible for fighting off the rival **Seagull Mafia** who feel they have a right to the catch.
    *   **Sappho and Jewels** act as the getaway team. Their job is to grab the loot and carry it to a secure staging area—a secluded clearing in the logging woods—before transporting it to the formal feast.
    *   Other **Sea Dogs and Lynx** are present, assisting with the broader heist operation.
*   **The Twist:** The heist begins well. The players successfully engage the Seagull Mafia while Sappho and Jewels make off with the fish. However, upon arriving at the ancient grove (their meeting place for coordination), they are ambushed by Mehitabel and Ra near the forgotten standing stones. Overburdened with their loot, they are easily overpowered.
*   **The Cataclysm:** At the climax of the heist, the shapeshifters shatter the ancient Speaking Stone at the center of the stone ring. The magical backlash instantly severs communication between all species. While the cats can still understand one another, the languages of the dogs and lynx become gibberish. The heist falls into chaos as the allied dogs and lynx suddenly can't understand each other or the players. They scatter in confusion.

*   **The Aftermath:** The players follow the trail to the ancient grove in the logging woods to find out what happened.
*   **The Discovery:** The players discover a ring of ancient standing stones with a shattered artifact at its center. A successful Lore check might reveal vague memories of old stories about these stones enabling communication between species.
*   **False Evidence:** The leaders of the Sea Dogs and Lynx clans arrive at the grove to investigate the chaos. They find signs of a struggle and the blood of both a dog and a lynx. Unable to communicate, they leap to the conclusion that they were betrayed by the other faction.
*   **The Players' Investigation:** The players must investigate the disappearance of Sappho and Jewels, piecing together the truth: their friends were ambushed and dragged away by humans after being left incapacitated.

### The Investigation (Act 2)

*   **Escalating Sabotage:** As the players work to understand what happened, the shapeshifters continue their campaign of chaos with a series of sabotage incidents designed to destabilize the fragile alliance and keep suspicion on the dog and lynx communities.
*   **Mounting Evidence:** Through investigation of these incidents, the players piece together clues that point toward the true culprits and the location where Sappho and Jewels are being held.

### The Rescues (Act 3)

*   **The Pound:** The players first stage a rescue for Sappho at the local Animal Control pound, securing one of the lost pieces of the Speaking Stone in the process.
*   **The Zoo & The Shell Game:** The final act takes place at the Silverfield Zoo, which is undergoing renovations. The players must rescue Jewels, who is being held in the veterinary clinic. However, Mehitabel and Ra are hiding among the zoo's feline inhabitants, playing a 'shell game' to confuse and ambush the players.
*   **Rampaging Machinery:** The shapeshifters use their powers to sabotage the construction equipment, turning excavators and bulldozers into rampaging threats, creating chaos and endangering the zoo's inhabitants. The players must simultaneously rescue Jewels and prevent a catastrophe.

### The Climax & Epilogue (Act 4)

*   **A Fragile Reunion:** After a tense chase, the players reunite Sappho and Jewels. With the shapeshifters defeated, the players have recovered all 11 shell fragments. Jewels reveals she has been protecting the 12th and final piece—the Jade Heart Stone, a green stone carved with the word for "love" in both Dog and Lynx conlangs. When the heart is placed within the reassembled shell, the Speaking Stone is magically mended and activated.
*   **A United Front:** The restored Stone allows Sappho and Jewels to quell the rising tensions between the Sea Dogs and Lynx clan, revealing the shapeshifters' treachery. The animal factions unite. The magic of the reforged stone also awakens full sentience in the surrounding zoo animals, who, enraged at the threat to their home, join the fight.
*   **The Final Battle:** The combined army of Parliament Cats, Sea Dogs, Lynx, and newly-empowered zoo animals confronts the shapeshifters. Overwhelmed, Mehitabel and Ra are defeated and captured, their fate to be decided later.
*   **A New World:** The adventure concludes with the fragile peace between the factions restored and a new social order beginning to form with the addition of dozens of newly sentient species. The shapeshifters' capture leaves a lingering thread for future adventures.

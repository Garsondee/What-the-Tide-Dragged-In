# Previous Adventure: The Case of the Greedy Ghost

This adventure took place approximately six months before the events of "What the Tide Dragged In."

## The Setup

On a late October night, four bored schoolchildren broke into the abandoned Silverfield silver mine, seeking a thrill. They stumbled upon the remains of Ezekiel Morton, a miner long dead, and pried four silver nuggets from his bony fingers before fleeing.

This act of desecration awakened the greedy ghost of Ezekiel Morton. Enraged, he used his spectral influence to control the mine's population of albino rats, their eyes now glowing an eerie green. His plan was simple and vengeful: manifest in the presence of his stolen silver, have the rats construct a mighty 'battle wagon,' and ride it into town to destroy the town hall (the "Ratthaus").

The player characters, members of the Cat Parliament, became involved when silver items began vanishing across town. Their investigation was given a personal stake when Remi, a sentient rat detective, reported that his boyfriend Basil, a rodent scientist, had been kidnapped by the albino rats to engineer the battle wagon.

Complicating matters, one of the children who had stolen a nugget was lured away by Wally the Failed Magician and became trapped in his magic shop, prompting a town-wide alert.

## The Adventure

*   **Act 1:** The players investigated the thefts and the missing girl. The climax of this act was a confrontation with Wally. They defeated the magician, rescued the girl, and recovered the first of the four cursed silver nuggets.

*   **Act 2:** Following the magical trail of the nugget, the players entered the Silverfield mine. They discovered Basil being held captive and a massive workshop where the rat army was building the battle wagon. Here, they were confronted by the ghost of Ezekiel Morton himself. They were unable to harm him, as they did not yet know his full and true name, and were forced to flee.

*   **Act 3:** The players conducted research at the Silverfield Historical Society, learning Ezekiel Morton's full name and the story of his greedy demise. After reclaiming the remaining three silver nuggets, they faced the ghost and his battle wagon in a climactic showdown in front of the town hall. During the battle, a player character named Mystic Mogg incited the albino rats to revolution. Weakened, the ghost was finally open to reason. The players informed him that the town hadn't forgotten himâ€”in fact, an exhibit at the Historical Society was dedicated to his memory. Appeased, the ghost faded away.

## The Aftermath

Following the ghost's defeat, many of the liberated rats formed a communist commune in a nearby union cafeteria, where Mystic Mogg now resides as a figure of some renown. The Feral Cats, who were also involved and defeated during the chase for the nuggets, never forgot their humiliation, setting the stage for their future vengeance.

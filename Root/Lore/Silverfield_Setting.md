# Silverfield: A Guide to "Strangefield"

## Overview

Silverfield—affectionately (and sometimes warily) dubbed "Strangefield" by locals—is a coastal town in Maine with a rich, strange history. On the surface, it appears to be a typical New England fishing community: weathered clapboard houses, a working harbor, tourist shops selling trinkets, and the ever-present cry of gulls. But beneath the mundane veneer lies a world of magic, sentient animals, occult secrets, and lingering curses from a dark industrial past.

The town sits at a peculiar intersection of the mundane and the mystical. Here, the veil between worlds is thin, and magic seeps through the cracks—sometimes literally, in the form of the enigmatic "silver mists" that roll in from the sea or up from the old mine shafts.

**Current Year:** The primary adventures are set around 1992, though Silverfield's strange history stretches back over a century.

## Geography & Key Locations

### The Harbor & Waterfront
The economic heart of Silverfield, where fishing boats return each evening with their catch. The harbor is a maze of weathered piers, creaking ropes, stacked lobster traps, and the constant presence of the **Seagull Mafia**—a surprisingly organized gang of gulls that treat the docks as their territory.

- **The Pierhead:** A concrete platform where catches are weighed, sorted, and sold. Crates of lobsters stack high beside battered pickup trucks.
- **The Docks:** Wooden piers where fisherfolk pass totes of seafood hand-to-hand in practiced rhythm.
- **The Harborfront:** Benches, food vendors, and tourist spots where locals eat fish and chips wrapped in paper while fending off opportunistic gulls.

The harbor is contested territory. The **Salty Sea Dogs** (a clan of piratical, seafaring dogs) claim ancestral rights to the waterfront, often clashing with the gulls and occasionally the Cat Parliament over fishing spoils.

### The Darkwoods (or "The Ancient Woods")
A primeval forest of towering pines and ancient oaks that rings the eastern edge of Silverfield. The Darkwoods are older than the town itself, and they *feel* it—the air is thick with old magic, the trees seem to listen, and the undergrowth shifts when you're not looking.

This is **Slynx territory**, home to the spiritual lynx clan who serve as guardians of the forest. They maintain magical ward-stones at key boundaries, though these wards have been weakening in recent years. The woods are laced with game trails, hidden clearings, and sacred groves. Humans rarely venture deep into the Darkwoods; those who do often return with stories of strange lights, phantom music, and the sensation of being watched.

Key features:
- **The Ward-Stones:** Ancient carved stones arranged in circles, humming with protective magic.
- **The Clearings:** Natural amphitheaters where the Slynx hold their rituals and councils.
- **The Eastern Boundary:** Where the woods meet the old silver mine—a place of particular magical instability.

### The Abandoned Silver Mine
On the outskirts of town, half-buried by time and deliberately sealed after the catastrophic cave-in of 1880, lies the **Silverfield Silver Mine**. Once the source of the town's prosperity during the late 19th-century silver boom, it's now a place of local legend and genuine danger.

The mine's silver was cursed—tainted by a dark pact made by the greedy foreman **Ezekiel Morton**. When Morton's body was never recovered after the cave-in, local lore claimed his spirit became bound to the albino rats that infested the tunnels, eventually coalescing into the monstrous **Rat King**.

The mine's tunnels are a labyrinth of collapsed shafts, unstable floors, and walls etched with symbols of naming magic. Lead-infused silver dust coats everything, and the air itself feels oppressive. Strange things happen here: equipment moves on its own, whispers echo from nowhere, and those who linger too long report visions and compulsions.

**Modern Status (1992):** Officially condemned and sealed. In reality, the seals are broken, and the mine's influence continues to leak into Silverfield. Four children broke into the mine on Halloween night, 1992, unknowingly reawakening Morton's curse by stealing four silver nuggets from his skeletal remains.

### Silverfield Lighthouse
A windswept lighthouse on the rocky coast, home to **Bundle**, an ancient cat of indeterminate age who serves as a lorekeeper and occasional oracle. The lighthouse is a place of refuge for those seeking wisdom—or at least cryptic warnings.

Bundle is often distracted by **pixies**—mischievous fey creatures who've taken a liking to her stories. The pixies are capricious, playful, and dangerous if offended, embodying the unpredictable nature of Silverfield's magical undercurrent.

### The Olde Magik Shop
A shadowy curiosity shop in Silverfield's older district, filled with dusty grimoires, questionable "charms," and authentic magical artifacts buried among the junk. The shop's basement is particularly notorious—a place where genuine sorcery has been attempted, often with disastrous results.

This was where the failed magician **Wally** discovered a grimoire written by Ezekiel Morton himself, filled with dark curses and naming magic. The shop's proprietor (if there still is one) turns a blind eye to what happens in the basement, whether out of ignorance, fear, or complicity.

### The Local Zoo
Silverfield's modest zoo is undergoing renovations as of the current adventure. It features a mix of local wildlife and more exotic animals, all housed in enclosures of varying quality. The zoo is significant for two reasons:

1. It's a neutral ground where the town's magical and mundane worlds intersect.
2. It's become a haven for **Ra**, a shapeshifting feral cat who uses the zoo to hide, travel, and scheme.

After the Speaking Stone is reforged in the current adventure, the zoo animals will experience a mass awakening of sentience—dozens of species suddenly gaining intelligence and language, fundamentally changing Silverfield's social order.

### The Animal Control Pound
A sterile, concrete building on the edge of town where stray and captured animals are held. To humans, it's a necessary civic facility. To the animal societies of Silverfield, it's a prison—cold, frightening, and a symbol of human power over their world.

The pound features:
- Rows of chain-link kennels
- A main office with records and equipment
- A veterinary area for sick or injured animals
- Specialized silver animal tags (important for containing shapeshifters)

### The Cat Parliament Grounds (Riverside Park Playground)
A children's playground in a small residential park that the cats have cleverly repurposed as their parliamentary meeting ground. The slide serves as the Speaker's podium, the jungle gym as tiered seating for factions, the swings as gallery seating, and the sandbox serves... multiple purposes, not all of them dignified.

The **Cat Parliament** convenes here weekly at dusk, presided over by a Speaker wielding the ceremonial Speaking Gavel. The playground's metal surfaces provide excellent acoustics for speeches, though the cats must keep their voices down to avoid attracting attention from the nearby residential houses. Decorum is usually maintained, though recent tensions have turned some sessions chaotic.

### The History Society Library & Graveyard
Run by **Mr. Graves**, a meticulous curator who may or may not be aware that his library is frequented by sentient cats. The library holds town records, obituaries, and historical documents dating back to Silverfield's founding.

The adjacent graveyard is old and atmospheric, with weathered tombstones and a resident ghostly magician who practices naming magic among the graves. The spirits here are generally benign but can be consulted by those who know how.

### The Abandoned Lobster Theme Park
A failed tourist attraction on Silverfield's outskirts, infamous for its surreal and poorly executed lobster motif—a kitschy nod to Maine's fishing industry that never quite caught on. Now abandoned, it's a maze of rusting rides, peeling paint, and echoing corridors.

The theme park serves as a hideout for outcasts, a playground for feral animals, and a repository for lost things. The Ferris wheel, in particular, has become a magpie's nest—a literal treasure trove of shiny stolen objects.

## History

### The Silver Boom (Late 1800s)
Silverfield experienced explosive growth during the silver boom of the 1870s-1880s. **Ezekiel Morton**, a ruthless mine foreman, made a dark pact with supernatural forces to secure a legendary vein of silver. The silver was cursed, though Morton either didn't know or didn't care.

The boom brought wealth, workers, and growth, transforming Silverfield from a sleepy fishing village into a bustling mining town. But the prosperity was built on blood and greed.

### The Cave-In of 1880
A catastrophic collapse trapped Morton and several miners deep underground. While most bodies were recovered, Morton's corpse was never found—only a horrifying tangle of albino rats near the sealed shaft.

Local legend claims Morton's greed cursed him to become a vengeful spirit, bound to the rats that fed on his remains. Over time, the spirit and the rats fused into the **Rat King**—a grotesque entity of sixteen rats with intertwined tails, animated by Morton's ghost and sustained by the cursed silver.

### The Decline
After the cave-in, Silverfield's silver industry collapsed. The mine was sealed, and the town returned to its roots as a fishing community. But the curse lingered. Periodic "rat plagues" swept through town—swarms of albino rats emerging from the old mine tunnels, stealing, spreading disease, and vanishing back into the earth.

### The Modern Era (1990s)
By 1992, Silverfield has settled into an uneasy equilibrium. It's a quirky coastal town with a dark history, known for:
- Excellent lobster and seafood
- Odd local legends and superstitions
- A disproportionate number of "strange occurrences"
- An unusually high population of cats, dogs, and other animals

Most humans are oblivious to the magical society thriving beneath their notice, though a few—like Mr. Graves or Bundle's unseen caretaker—seem to sense something more.

### Recent Events: The Defeat of the Rat King (1991)
In the autumn of 1991, four children broke into the abandoned mine on a dare. They discovered Ezekiel Morton's skeleton clutching four glittering silver nuggets and took them as trophies. This theft reawakened Morton's curse.

The Rat King, empowered by rage and dark magic, began hoarding stolen items—tools, mechanical parts, silver trinkets—to construct a **Silver Chariot**, a supernatural battle lawnmower that would extend the King's power beyond the mine and allow it to terrorize Silverfield.

A coalition of player cats, aided by **Remy** (a trenchcoat-clad PI rat) and **Basil** (Remy's missing love), confronted the Rat King in a climactic midnight battle. Using naming magic and the recovered silver nuggets, they performed a ritual to either banish Morton's spirit or bind it and destroy the Rat King entirely.

The curse was lifted, the silver turned to dust, and peace—fragile and temporary—returned to Silverfield.

**The Theme Park Incident:** The climactic battle took place at the abandoned lobster theme park on Silverfield's outskirts. During the confrontation, a Ferris wheel was knocked loose from its moorings. The massive wheel rolled through the park, crashing through the ramshackle settlement that served as the Feral Cats' final stronghold. It continued rolling until it plunged into the sea, taking with it the last remnants of the Feral Cats' territory, supplies, and sense of belonging.

While the player cats celebrated their victory over the Rat King, the Feral Cats were left to pick through the rubble of their destroyed home. This catastrophic loss—barely noticed by the triumphant Cat Parliament—would become the seed of **Mehitabel's** bitter resentment and her eventual plot for revenge.

**Consequences:**
- The walls of reality were weakened, allowing more "silver mists" (fey magic) to seep into the world
- The animal factions gained new respect for collaboration
- The Cat Parliament emerged as a recognized power, mediating between species
- But old grudges and new ambitions festered, setting the stage for the current adventure

## Factions & Societies

### The Cat Parliament
The most organized of Silverfield's animal societies. The Parliament is a representative democracy where cats from various neighborhoods—Harborfront, Warehouse District, the Suburbs—debate policy and settle disputes.

**Current Status:** Ascendant. After defeating the Rat King and brokering peace between dogs and lynx, the Cat Parliament has become a de facto mediator and leader among Silverfield's animal factions.

**Key Figures:**
- **The Speaker:** An elder tabby of impeccable bearing (currently missing in Act 0 of the current adventure, having gone to investigate the Darkwoods).
- **The Player Cats:** Heroes of the Rat King affair, now tasked with protecting the fragile alliance.

### The Salty Sea Dogs
A clan of seafaring dogs who claim ancestral rights to the harbor. Piratical in attitude, loyal to their own, and deeply tied to maritime traditions.

**Culture:** The Sea Dogs value bravery, loyalty, and a good story. They're boisterous, competitive, and prone to dramatics. They speak their own dialect—Dog-Conlang—which becomes crucial when the Speaking Stone is shattered.

**Notable Member:**
- **Sappho:** A golden Labrador with a piratical flair and a heart of gold. Sappho is courageous, loyal, and deeply in love with Jewels the lynx—a relationship that symbolizes the new alliance between species.

### The Slynx Clan
The lynx guardians of the Darkwoods, practitioners of ancient warding magic and spiritual rituals. The Slynx are isolationist, formal, and deeply tied to the land.

**Culture:** The Slynx value tradition, duty, and the preservation of sacred spaces. They're suspicious of outsiders—especially dogs and humans—but can be swayed by genuine need and respect for their ways. They speak Lynx-Conlang, a language rich in metaphor and ritual phrasing.

**Key Figures:**
- **Big Lynx:** The territorial elder of the clan, proud and protective.
- **Jewels:** A young, curious lynx who questions tradition and believes in unity. Jewels is in love with Sappho, and their relationship is a beacon of hope for inter-species cooperation.

### The Seagull Mafia
An organized gang of gulls who treat the harbor as their territory. Surprisingly cunning and utterly ruthless about food, the Seagull Mafia operates in coordinated flocks, conducting raids, intimidating rivals, and enforcing their will through sheer numbers.

**Tactics:** Dive-bombing, distraction, overwhelming force. Individual gulls aren't particularly dangerous, but a flock acting in concert can drive off much larger threats.

### The Feral Cats
A disgraced faction, defeated and scattered after the Rat King affair. Once a powerful force in Silverfield's underworld, the Feral Cats are now a shadow of their former selves.

**History:** The Feral Cats claimed the abandoned lobster theme park as their territory, building a makeshift community among the rusting rides and peeling paint. It wasn't much, but it was theirs—until the climactic battle with the Rat King. A runaway Ferris wheel, knocked loose during the fight, rolled through their settlement and plunged into the sea, destroying everything the Feral Cats had left.

**Current Status:** Most have integrated into other communities or left town, nursing quiet resentments. But a few—like **Mehitabel (Nightpaw)**—nurse bitter grudges and active plots for revenge. To them, the Cat Parliament's victory came at the cost of the Feral Cats' complete destruction, and that debt has yet to be paid.

### The Pixies
Mischievous fey creatures who embody the unpredictable magic seeping into Silverfield. The pixies are neither wholly good nor evil—they value stories, tricks, and shiny objects, and they reward kindness as capriciously as they punish rudeness.

**Abilities:** Illusion magic, minor telekinesis, the ability to "turn up anywhere." Bundle warns that it's always best to be nice to the fey.

### The Rats
Silverfield's rats fall into two broad categories:

1. **Ordinary Rats:** Clever, opportunistic, and numerous. They form loose communities in alleys, sewers, and forgotten spaces.
2. **The Albino Rats:** Twisted by prolonged exposure to the mine's cursed silver. These rats are larger, more aggressive, and susceptible to supernatural control. Most served the Rat King until his defeat.

**Notable Rats:**
- **Remy:** A trenchcoat-clad private investigator rat, nervous but determined. Remy was instrumental in defeating the Rat King and is searching for his missing love, Basil.
- **Basil:** Remy's partner, kidnapped by the Rat King and held in a silver cage. Basil's rescue was key to breaking the King's power.

## Magic & The Supernatural

### The Speaking Stone
A magical artifact of unknown origin, the Speaking Stone allows all animal species to understand each other's languages. It's unclear who created it or why, but it's been a cornerstone of inter-species cooperation in Silverfield.

**Appearance:** A smooth, egg-shaped stone covered in glowing glyphs.

**Function:** Acts as a universal translator for animal speech. When intact, all animals within Silverfield can communicate across species barriers.

**Weakness:** The Stone can be shattered, breaking into fragments that must be recovered and ritually reforged. When broken, each species reverts to speaking only its native tongue, causing immediate chaos and suspicion.

### Naming Magic
A tradition rooted in fey lore: true names have power, and knowing a creature's name allows you to command, bind, or harm it. Naming magic is particularly effective against ghosts and spirits, who lack physical forms but are vulnerable to being named.

**Techniques:**
- **Binding:** Speaking a true name while performing a ritual can trap or control a spirit.
- **Reversal:** Writing a name backward can reverse a creature's essence or weaken a curse.
- **Renaming:** Powerful enchanters can temporarily alter a creature's nature by imposing a false name.

**Dangers:** Naming magic is volatile. Mispronouncing a name, using it without proper preparation, or attempting to name something too powerful can backfire catastrophically.

### The Silver Curse
The silver mined from the Silverfield Silver Mine was tainted by Ezekiel Morton's dark pact. Prolonged exposure causes madness, mutation, and supernatural corruption.

**Effects:**
- Albino rats exposed to silver dust become larger, more aggressive, and susceptible to ghostly control.
- Objects made from cursed silver can anchor spirits to the physical world.
- Creatures carrying cursed silver experience paranoia, greed, and violent urges.
- The curse can only be broken by naming magic or by destroying the silver entirely.

### The Silver Mists
A phenomenon unique to Silverfield: thick, luminous fog that rolls in from the sea or rises from the old mine. The mists are neither entirely natural nor purely magical—they're a manifestation of the weakened barriers between the mundane world and the realms of fey and spirit.

**Effects:**
- Enhanced magic and easier access to supernatural abilities
- Increased fey activity (pixies, will-o'-wisps, stranger things)
- Disorientation and altered perceptions in humans
- Strengthened connections to the past (ghosts become more active)

### Ward-Stones & Protective Magic
The Slynx maintain ancient ward-stones throughout the Darkwoods, carved with spiraling glyphs that resonate with protective magic. These wards:
- Keep intruders out
- Contain dangerous entities within
- Stabilize the barriers between worlds
- Require regular maintenance and can be broken by sabotage or neglect

## Themes & Tone

Silverfield adventures blend:
- **Noir Detective Mystery:** Investigations, clues, and conspiracies lurking beneath the surface
- **Whimsical Animal Antics:** Playing as cats, dogs, and other creatures navigating a world built for humans
- **Occult Horror:** Curses, ghosts, and forces that threaten both the mundane and magical worlds
- **Found Family & Community:** Factions learning to trust and cooperate despite old grudges
- **The Thin Veil:** The constant tension between the ordinary and the extraordinary

Silverfield is a place where you might spend one scene staging an elaborate heist to steal lobsters from the docks, and the next confronting a vengeful ghost in a cursed mine. It's silly and serious, mundane and magical, dangerous and heartwarming—often all at once.

---

## Open Questions & Future Threats

- **Who created the Speaking Stone, and why?**
- **What other bargains has Ezekiel Morton made, and are they still active?**
- **How far do the silver mists extend, and what's coming through them?**
- **Are there other shapeshifters besides Mehitabel and Ra?**
- **What will the newly awakened zoo animals do now that they're sentient?**
- **Who are the "outside patrons" hinted at in the shapeshifters' documents?**

Silverfield endures, but its peace is always fragile, and new mysteries are always waiting to surface from the depths—whether from the sea, the mine, or the spaces between worlds.

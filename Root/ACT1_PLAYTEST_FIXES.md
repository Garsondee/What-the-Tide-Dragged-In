# Act 1 Playtest Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Date: Oct 30, 2025

This document summarizes the changes made to Act 1 based on the playtest conducted with the four test PCs (Whisker, Cinder, Silk, and Driftwood).

---

## Changes to Scene 1: The Harbour Heist

### **ADDED: Read-Aloud Opening Section**

**Issue Addressed:** Scene lacked opening context connecting from Act 0 and establishing why the PCs are participating.

**Solution:** Added a comprehensive opening that:
- Connects from Act 0 (defeat of Wally, shapeshifter threat revealed)
- Establishes the Feast of the Speaking Stone as an annual tradition
- Explains the alliance between Cat Parliament, Sea Dogs, and Slynx clan
- Clarifies each faction's role in the heist
- Explains Sappho and Jewels' romantic subplot and their reason for volunteering as getaway team
- Emphasizes that the Speaking Stone enables inter-species communication
- Sets the stakes: cementing a fragile alliance through celebration

**Key Quote:** 
> "Thanks to its power, you can understand Sappho's barks and Jewels' lynx-speech as clearly as you understand your fellow cats. The alliance is fragile, yes, but tonight—with communication flowing and good food on the way—it feels like anything is possible."

### **ADDED: Speaking Stone Magic Flows (Situation Aspect)**

**Issue Addressed:** Ambiguity about whether inter-species communication works before the Stone breaks.

**Solution:** Added explicit situation aspect "Speaking Stone Magic Flows (all species can communicate clearly)" to Scene 1 to eliminate any confusion.

### **ENHANCED: Sappho & Jewels NPC Description**

**Issue Addressed:** Unclear what the getaway team is doing during the scene.

**Solution:** Expanded their description to show:
- They work efficiently together and are clearly in sync
- Sappho uses her sea-dog strength for heavy lifting
- Jewels uses her lynx agility for scouting and watching
- They're professional but occasionally exchange loving glances
- They have a legitimate reason to leave early (transporting the catch to feast site)

## Changes to Scene 2: The Seagulls Descend

### **ADDED: Read-Aloud Opening Section**

**Issue Addressed:** Missing transition from Scene 1 and context for the gull attack.

**Solution:** Added opening that:
- Shows Sappho and Jewels departing successfully with the catch
- Establishes the remaining dogs and lynx are still helping organize
- Describes the Gull Mafia's terrifying descent
- Emphasizes the slippery lobsters and lack of cover

### **REWROTE: The Twist Section**

**Issue Addressed:** Making the Stone breaking more mysterious, emphasizing it happens off-screen, and clarifying it's unavoidable.

**Old Version:**
> "At the height of the battle with the gulls, the Speaking Stone is shattered."

**New Version:**
> "At the height of the battle with the gulls, you feel it—a sudden, visceral *wrongness* that ripples through the air like thunder without sound. The Speaking Stone has been shattered. Somewhere in the woods, far from your eyes, something terrible has happened."

**Key Changes:**
- PCs don't witness it directly—they FEEL it happening far away
- Emphasizes the mysterious, visceral nature of the magical backlash
- Makes clear it happens "somewhere in the woods, far from your eyes"
- Removes any implication PCs could have prevented it

### **ADDED: Communication Breakdown Description**

**Issue Addressed:** Clarify exactly what happens when the Stone breaks.

**Solution:** Added detailed explanation:
- House Cats can still understand each other
- Dog-Conlang and Lynx-Conlang become incomprehensible noise
- Dogs and lynx can't understand each other either
- Panic and accusations erupt immediately
- The fragile alliance shatters along with the Stone

### **FIXED: Potential Outcomes**

**Issue Addressed:** Contradiction between Potential Outcomes and The Twist about Sappho and Jewels.

**Old Version (Success):**
> "However, they are left bewildered as their allies, Sappho and Jewels, suddenly flee the scene in terror."

**New Version (Success):**
> "However, they're left bewildered by the magical catastrophe and the sudden breakdown of the alliance. Their allies scatter in confusion, and Sappho and Jewels have vanished—they were already gone when the Stone broke. Where are they? What happened?"

**Key Changes:**
- Removed "flee in terror" language (contradicts the ambush)
- Emphasizes Sappho and Jewels had already left before the Stone broke
- Frames it as a mystery: where are they? what happened?
- All outcomes now consistently reference their disappearance rather than flight

### **ENHANCED: Linguistic Clues**

**Issue Addressed:** Confusion about who can understand what.

**Solution:**
- Changed dialogue to show it's now incomprehensible: "*Bark bark! Growl-woof bark?! BARK!*"
- Added parenthetical notes explaining tone/body language is still readable
- Added explicit GM note explaining the communication rules before and after the break

### **ENHANCED: Levers & Buttons**

**Issue Addressed:** "The Prize is Slippery!" wasn't integrated into gameplay.

**Solution:** Added new lever:
> "**Wrangle the Slippery Prize:** Overcome with Athletics/Physique to maintain grip on lobster crates during the chaos. The Prize is Slippery! can be compelled to force drops or invoked by gulls to snatch crates mid-carry."

Also added:
- Modified "Rally Allies" to note difficulty increase after Stone breaks
- Added "Sense the Wrongness" passive check (DC 3) to let PCs feel something terrible happening before communication fails

### **ENHANCED: Hidden/Discoverable Aspects**

**Issue Addressed:** Making clues more specific and useful.

**Changes:**
- "Odd Feather Markings" now explicitly notes this was a coordinated distraction
- "Stone Resonance" clarified as detectible after the break, pointing toward the grove
- "Footprints Toward the Trysting Spot" now explicitly leads to the Speaking Stone's grove

## Changes to Gull Mafia Stat Block

### **ENHANCED: Full Stat Block Expansion**

**Issue Addressed:** Making the Gull Mafia more fun and flavorful as opponents.

**Additions:**
1. **Description Section:** Added flavor text explaining their organization, tactics, and claim to harbor territory
2. **Additional Aspect:** "Ancestral Rights to the Harbor (or so they claim)"
3. **New Stunts:**
   - **Snatch and Scatter:** Once per scene auto-steal mechanic that creates dramatic choices
   - **The Mob Mentality:** Consequence = flock fragmenting (narrative guidance)
4. **GM Notes Section:** Guidance on playing them as both threatening and ridiculous, using environment, escalation tactics, and defining "defeat"

**Key Philosophy:**
> "Play them as both threatening and ridiculous: They're dangerous in numbers but individually pathetic."

---

## Design Principles Reinforced

### **1. The Speaking Stone Breaking is Unavoidable**
- It's the inciting incident for the entire adventure
- PCs don't witness it—they experience its effects
- Mehitabel and Ra break it off-screen while the PCs are distracted
- This is intentional railroading for narrative necessity

### **2. Sappho and Jewels' Capture**
- They leave early legitimately (transporting catch to feast site)
- Their secret detour to the trysting spot is their personal agenda
- They arrive at the Speaking Stone grove by coincidence
- They witness/interrupt the breaking but fail to prevent it
- They're overpowered and captured while the PCs are at the docks

### **3. Inter-Species Communication Rules**
- Before break: ALL species understand each other via Stone magic
- After break: House Cats understand House Cats only
- This creates immediate chaos and the alliance breakdown
- Act 0 must establish that communication works perfectly beforehand

### **4. Interactive Aspects**
- Situation aspects should have clear mechanical applications
- "The Prize is Slippery!" now has compel and invoke guidance
- Levers & Buttons should reference aspects explicitly

---

## Remaining Considerations

### **Things NOT Changed (by design):**

1. **The Twist is predetermined** - This is intentional. The adventure requires the Stone to break for the story to progress. Player agency is preserved in HOW they respond, not WHETHER it happens.

2. **No Speaking Stone fragments in Scene 2** - The Stone is shattered in the woods at the grove, not at the docks. PCs won't find fragments until they investigate the grove (presumably in Act 2).

3. **Gull Mafia stats are deliberately modest** - They're meant to be beatable but numerous. The challenge is managing the chaos while dealing with multiple threats (gulls + communication breakdown).

### **Dependencies on Act 0:**

Act 0 must clearly establish:
- The Speaking Stone exists and enables inter-species communication
- The Cat Parliament, Sea Dogs, and Slynx are tentatively working together
- Shapeshifters (Mehitabel and Ra) are the real threat
- The feast planning has been ongoing as a diplomatic gesture

## Playtest Validation

The test run with Whisker, Cinder, Silk, and Driftwood showed:
- **Strengths:** GM Guidance tools, zone structure, multiple solution paths, dramatic twist
- **Weaknesses Fixed:** Context, NPC actions, outcome contradictions, aspect integration
- **Dice Performance:** PCs succeeded frequently (4 Success with Style, 6 Success, 2 Ties, 1 Failure out of 11 rolls)
- **fate_roller.py:** Worked perfectly; verbose GM instruction output was very helpful

---

## Files Modified

1. `Root/Scenes/Act1/01_01_The_Harbour_Heist.md` - Added opening frame, enhanced NPCs
2. `Root/Scenes/Act1/01_02_The_Seagulls_Descend.md` - Added opening, rewrote twist, fixed outcomes
3. `Root/Scenes/Act1/01_02_The_Seagulls_Descend_Characters/Gull_Mafia.md` - Expanded stat block

---

## Next Steps

Consider:
1. Creating a formal Act 0 → Act 1 transition scene or interstitial
2. Adding a Scene 3 to Act 1 for investigating the Speaking Stone grove
3. Ensuring Act 2 Scene 1 properly follows up on the clues from Act 1 Scene 2
4. Reviewing all mentions of Sappho and Jewels throughout to ensure pronoun consistency (both are female, use she/her)

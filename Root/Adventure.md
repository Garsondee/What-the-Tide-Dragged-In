# What the Tide Dragged In

### A Note on Act 0

Act 0 is designed as a self-contained introductory mini-adventure. Its primary purpose is threefold:
1.  **Mechanical Refresher:** To reintroduce players to the core mechanics of Fate Core in a low-stakes environment.
2.  **World-Building:** To establish the new status quo where cats, dogs, and lynxes can communicate and interact. The source of this universal communication will become a mystery in the main adventure.
3.  **Narrative Foundation:** To stage the first meeting between Sappho and Jewels, allowing the players to witness the beginning of an unusual cross-species partnership. This provides a strong emotional anchor for the events of the main adventure.

## Introduction

This is a Fate Core adventure set in the seaside town of Silverfield, where animal factions hold their own parliaments, wage their own wars, and keep their own secrets. It has been a year of tense peace since the defeat of the wraithful Ezekiel Morton, and the Cat Parliament is preparing the Harvest Feast—an autumn celebration of bounty and friendship—with their newfound allies: the piratical Salty Sea Dogs and the shamanistic Lynx clan.

This adventure begins with a simple heist that spirals into a full-blown crisis. An ancient magical artifact hidden deep in the logging woods—the Speaking Stone—is shattered into **11 shell fragments** by shadowy figures. The cat player characters can still understand each other, but the languages of the dogs and lynx suddenly become unintelligible. What was broken? Why could they all communicate before? The mystery unfolds as the players investigate.

The players must use a physical prop—a clay egg inscribed with an ancient prophecy in three parallel languages—to decipher the 'Dog' and 'Lynx' conlangs. The inscription on the Speaking Stone reads: *"By silver stream, this stone was cleaved, to save a people once aggrieved. Should it lie broken, words unspoken, a fight will start around this token. If jade heart finds final home, then Lynx and Dogs will soon atone. A path to love can then be shown."* Throughout the adventure, they will collect phrases in these coded fonts from NPCs. By using the inscription as a translation key, they can regain the ability to communicate, piece by piece. Their ultimate goal is to find all 11 shell fragments and the secret **12th piece**—a jade heart stone inscribed with the word "love"—expose the true villains, and reforge the Speaking Stone, restoring universal communication and preventing a war.

## The Hook

The adventure starts *in media res* with a heist. The players (The Cat Parliament) are the muscle, tasked with fending off the rival Seagull Mafia while their allies secure the catch for the Harvest Feast. The getaway team consists of **Sappho** (a dog) and **Jewels** (a lynx)—an unusually coordinated cross-species pair who volunteered to transport the catch to a secure staging area in the old logging woods. The heist is thrown into chaos when something terrible happens in those distant woods—a magical catastrophe that instantly cuts off all inter-species communication. In the confusion, Sappho and Jewels are ambushed near the ancient stone circle by the true culprits and captured by humans. The now-uncommunicative dog and lynx factions, unable to understand even the players, immediately suspect each other of treachery.

## The Opposition

The primary antagonists are a pair of disenfranchised shapeshifting Feral Cats, embittered by their defeat at the players' hands a year ago.

*   **Mehitabel (Nightpaw):** A high-ranking and vengeful member of the Feral Cats. She feels her faction was robbed of its territory and respect. Her goal is to sow chaos and dismantle the alliance between the cats, dogs, and lynx, proving that the Cat Parliament is unfit to lead.
*   **Ra:** Mehitabel's partner in crime. A fellow shapeshifter and a recent arrival, Ra was a disgruntled tenant at the local zoo who saw an opportunity for chaos and power by allying with the disgraced Feral Cat.

Their plan is to destroy an ancient artifact that enables inter-species communication, frame the dog and lynx representatives, incite a war between the factions, and use the ensuing chaos to seize power and reclaim their lost territory. They are not afraid to get their paws dirty and will use deception, sabotage, and brute force to achieve their goals.

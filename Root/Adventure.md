# What the Tide Dragged In

### A Note on Act 0

Act 0 is designed as a self-contained introductory mini-adventure. Its primary purpose is threefold:
1.  **Mechanical Refresher:** To reintroduce players to the core mechanics of Fate Core in a low-stakes environment.
2.  **World-Building:** To establish the new status quo where cats, dogs, and lynxes can communicate and interact, which was not the case in previous adventures.
3.  **Narrative Foundation:** To stage the first meeting between Sappho and Jewels, allowing the players to witness the beginning of their relationship. This provides a strong emotional anchor for the events of the main adventure.

## Introduction

This is a Fate Core adventure set in the seaside town of Silverfield, where animal factions hold their own parliaments, wage their own wars, and keep their own secrets. It has been a year of tense peace since the defeat of the wraithful Ezekiel Morton, and the Cat Parliament is preparing a celebratory feast with their newfound allies: the piratical Salty Sea Dogs and the shamanistic Slynx (Lynx) clan. 

This adventure begins with a simple task that spirals into a full-blown crisis. A magical 'Speaking Stone' that allows inter-species communication is shattered into **11 pieces** by shadowy figures. The cat player characters can still understand each other, but the languages of the dogs and lynx have become unintelligible.

The players must use a physical prop—a clay egg acting as a Rosetta Stone with two coded languages—to decipher the 'Dog' and 'Lynx' conlangs. Throughout the adventure, they will collect phrases in these coded fonts from NPCs. By solving this puzzle, they can regain the ability to communicate, piece by piece. Their ultimate goal is to find all 11 fragments of the Speaking Stone, expose the true villains, and reforge the stone, restoring universal communication and preventing a war.

## The Hook

The adventure starts *in media res* with a heist. The players (The Cat Parliament) are the muscle, tasked with fending off the rival Seagull Mafia while their allies secure the catch for an upcoming feast. The getaway team consists of the star-crossed lovers, **Sappho** (a dog) and **Jewels** (a lynx), who use the mission as a pretext to sneak away to their trysting spot. The heist is thrown into chaos when the nearby **Speaking Stone** is shattered, instantly cutting off all inter-species communication. In the confusion, Sappho and Jewels are ambushed at their trysting spot by the true culprits and are captured by humans. The now-uncommunicative dog and lynx factions, unable to understand even the players, immediately suspect each other of treachery.

## The Opposition

The primary antagonists are a pair of disenfranchised shapeshifting Feral Cats, embittered by their defeat at the players' hands a year ago.

*   **Mehitabel (Nightpaw):** A high-ranking and vengeful member of the Feral Cats. She feels her faction was robbed of its territory and respect. Her goal is to sow chaos and dismantle the alliance between the cats, dogs, and lynx, proving that the Cat Parliament is unfit to lead.
*   **Ra:** Mehitabel's partner in crime. A fellow shapeshifter and a recent arrival, Ra was a disgruntled tenant at the local zoo who saw an opportunity for chaos and power by allying with the disgraced Feral Cat.

Their plan is to frame the dog and lynx lovers for breaking the Speaking Stone, incite a war between the factions, and use the ensuing chaos to seize power and reclaim their lost territory. They are not afraid to get their paws dirty and will use deception, sabotage, and brute force to achieve their goals.

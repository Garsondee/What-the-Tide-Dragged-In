## The Hidden History (GM Knowledge)

### Timeline: Hundreds of Years Ago

**~1000 CE - The Viking Arrival**
- Viking longboats arrive on the coast of what will become Maine
- They bring with them dogs—loyal companions and fierce guardians
- Dogs establish themselves along the harbor and coastal territories
- The native Lynx clan has long held dominion over the deep forests

**The Territorial Disruption**
- Dogs need coastal territory for fishing and protection
- Lynx see the coast as part of their ancestral hunting grounds
- The arrival of seafaring dogs disrupts the ancient balance
- Border skirmishes begin

**The Escalation**
- **Dogs:** Emboldened by seafaring courage, raid lynx territories near shore
- **Lynx:** Masters of the woods, ambush dogs who stray inland
- **The Fatal Barrier:** Neither side can understand the other's language
- Fear and miscommunication turn every encounter into violence
- Conflict threatens mutual destruction

**The Miracle by the Silver Stream**
- In the contested borderlands, by silver streams between territories
- Unknown hands create the Speaking Stone (Fey? Ancient shamans? The land itself?)
- The stone's magic: enables all creatures to understand one another
- **First Communication:** Dogs and lynx hear each other's fears and needs for the first time

**The Peace**
- Understanding enables negotiation
- Territorial agreements drawn: Coast/harbor to dogs, deep woods to lynx, borderlands shared
- The Speaking Stone placed in the grove as testament to peace through communication
- The Jade Heart inscribed with "love"—not romance, but the understanding that enables coexistence

**The Centuries Pass**
- Vikings depart, dogs become the Salty Sea Dogs (piratical culture rooted in seafaring traditions)
- Lynx remain in the woods, guardians of old magic
- The Speaking Stone works so well that new generations forget it exists
- Universal communication becomes "natural"—no one questions its source

**~1700s CE - The Cat Arrival**
- Human settlers bring house cats
- Cats form the Cat Parliament, never knowing communication once required magic
- The stone ring becomes "the old standing stones"—sacred but purpose forgotten
- Only oldest stories hint at the dog/lynx war, and they sound like myths

**Present Day**
- No living animal knows the complete truth
- The grove is "just another clearing" (except to those who use it as a meeting place)
- Until it shatters, and history threatens to repeat...

## The Prophecy's True Historical Meaning

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**"By silver stream, this stone was cleaved,"**
- **Location:** The borderland streams between dog and lynx territories
- **Action:** The stone was intentionally split (cleaved) into shell and heart
- **Purpose:** Part of the peace ritual, or to prevent misuse

**"To save a people once aggrieved."**
- **The Aggrieved:** BOTH dogs and lynx
  - Dogs: Displaced from Viking homelands, seeking new territory
  - Lynx: Invaded in their ancestral forests by foreign species
- **The Saving:** Communication prevented mutual annihilation

**"Should it lie broken, words unspoken,"**
- **Warning:** Breaking the stone removes the magic of communication
- **Consequence:** Species revert to their native tongues
- **Result:** The original barrier of miscommunication returns

**"A fight will start around this token."**
- **Historical Echo:** The Viking-age war will repeat
- **Modern Application:** Dogs and lynx will blame each other
- **Inevitability:** Without communication, fear leads to violence

**"If jade heart finds final home,"**
- **The Solution:** The heart must return to the shell's center
- **Symbolic:** The "heart" of understanding must be restored
- **Practical:** Only the complete stone (shell + heart) has power

**"Then Lynx and Dogs will soon atone."**
- **Atonement:** Not punishment, but reconciliation
- **Historical Parallel:** Just as their ancestors made peace, they can too
- **Hope:** The cycle of violence can be broken again

**"A path to love can then be shown."**
- **Original Meaning:** Love (understanding, empathy) enabled peace centuries ago
- **Current Meaning:** Sappho & Jewels' romance embodies this principle
- **Universal Truth:** Love across boundaries is the answer to ancient hatreds

## GM Guidance: Revealing the History

### Lore Check Results

**DC 3 (Average) - Common Knowledge:**
> "There are old standing stones somewhere in the logging woods. The elder animals say they're important, but I don't know why. Something about the old days?"

**DC 5 (Fair) - Vague Legends:**
> "I've heard stories about standing stones in the deep woods that had something to do with communication between species. Supposedly, long ago, animals couldn't understand each other the way we do now. The stones fixed that somehow? But that doesn't make sense—we've always been able to talk to each other... haven't we?"

**DC 7 (Good) - Ancient Tales:**
> "The very oldest tales speak of a time when dogs first came to these shores with the longboat people. They fought with the lynx over territory. The war was terrible—neither side could understand the other, so fear ruled. Then something magical happened in the borderlands. A stone was created that let everyone understand each other. After that, peace was possible. The dogs got the coast, the lynx kept the deep woods, and the fighting stopped."

**DC 9 (Great) - Historical Truth:**
> "The Speaking Stone. That's what it was called in the oldest stories. An egg-shaped artifact that translated all animal speech. It had a jade heart at its center, inscribed with an important word—though what word, the stories don't say. It was placed in a ring of standing stones in the logging woods, right at the border between dog and lynx territories. As long as it remained whole, all creatures could understand each other. The inscription on the stone was a prophecy and a warning: if the stone broke, communication would fail, and the old war would return."

### When to Reveal History

**Act 1, Scene 3 - The Aftermath:**
- Players find the broken stone and pedestal
- Fair (+2) Lore check reveals vague legends
- Good (+3) Lore check reveals the dog/lynx war story

**Act 2 - Investigation:**
- Players question elders of dog and lynx factions
- Each faction has fragments of the story
- Piecing together both sides reveals the complete history

**Act 3 - The Reveal:**
- When the stone is reassembled, the inscription becomes clear
- Sappho & Jewels' bond mirrors the original peace
- The jade heart's inscription ("love") ties past to present

### Narrative Moments

**Moment of Recognition:**
> "Wait... this has happened before! Dogs and lynx, unable to understand each other, ready to fight. This isn't new—this is HISTORY REPEATING!"

**The Elder's Warning:**
> "My grandmother told me stories her grandmother told her. Stories of blood in the borderlands, of fear without words, of a time before understanding. She said the stones kept that darkness at bay. And we forgot. Fools that we are, we forgot."

**The Realization:**
> "The prophecy says 'a people once aggrieved.' Not cats—DOGS and LYNX. They were the aggrieved peoples. The stone was made for them, to save them from destroying each other!"

## Using This History in Your Game

### Foreshadowing (Early Hints)

**NPC Elder Musing:**
> "My grandmother used to say the old ones had it right—keep to your territory, respect the boundaries. The coast for the sea-folk, the deep woods for the forest-folk, and peace in between."

**Passing Reference:**
> "The Sea Dogs have always been pirates at heart. I think they got it from their ancestors—sailors from far away who came here seeking new territory."

**Mysterious Warning:**
> "Those stones in the woods... my grandmother said they kept something terrible from happening again. But she never said what."

### The Discovery (Mid-Adventure)

**Finding the Broken Stone:**
> "The pedestal is ancient—older than any human settlement in Silverfield. The inscription is weathered but still legible. Three languages, stacked one above the other. A warning. A prophecy. A history forgotten."

**Piecing Together the Truth:**
> "So the dogs came from across the sea... and the lynx were already here... and they fought because they couldn't understand each other... and THAT'S why the stone was made! To let them communicate! To make peace possible!"

### The Climax (Revelation)

**When Jewels Reveals the Jade Heart:**
> "Sappho and I... we didn't know we were repeating history. We didn't know that centuries ago, love between our peoples was what made peace possible. We just knew we loved each other. And now... now that love will save everyone, just like it did then."

**The Final Understanding:**
> "The stone doesn't create love—it creates UNDERSTANDING. And understanding creates the possibility of love. That's what it's always done. That's what it will always do."

3. **Love Transcends Boundaries:** Not just romance, but empathy and respect
4. **Forgetting Is Dangerous:** Losing history means losing wisdom

### Shared Stunts

*   **A Thousand Faces:** As shapeshifters, Mehitabel and Ra can spend a Fate point to create a disguise that is physically indistinguishable from a chosen animal (cat, dog, or lynx). This disguise is a situation aspect with one free invocation. To see through it, a character must succeed on an opposed Investigate vs. Deceive roll, and even then, they may only notice that "something is off."
*   **Whispers and Lies:** +2 to Deceive when spreading misinformation to create conflict between groups.
*   **Gremlin in the Machine:** When near complex human machinery, they can spend a Fate Point to cause it to malfunction spectacularly. This creates a new hostile Situation Aspect (e.g., `Rampaging Excavator`, `Haywire Electrical System`) with a free invocation for them to use.

**Stress & Consequences (Shared Pool):**

*   **Mental:** [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
*   **Mild (2):**

# Romance Reveal Fix Summary
## Preserving the Sappho/Jewels Relationship Twist

**Date:** Oct 30, 2025  
**Issue:** The romantic relationship between Sappho (dog) and Jewels (lynx) was being explicitly revealed in Act 0-1 materials, ruining the emotional impact of the Act 3 reveal.

**Solution:** Remove all explicit romance references before Act 3, Scene 2. Replace with hints of unusual partnership and coordination.

---

## The New Reveal Strategy

### **Before Act 3, Scene 2:** HINTS ONLY
Players should notice:
- Sappho and Jewels work together with unusual coordination
- They communicate with subtle gestures and brief glances
- They move "like they've been partners for years"
- They've been meeting in the woods (for "coordination drills")
- Other animals watch them with admiration and puzzlement
- They volunteered together for the mission

Players should wonder: *How did they get so coordinated? What's their deal?*

### **Act 3, Scene 2:** THE REVEAL
Jewels produces the Jade Heart Stone and says:
> "Sappho and I... we made a vow on this stone. It was to be our secret‚Äîa promise that our love could bridge any divide."

**This is the moment** players learn they're in love. The cross-species romance is the twist.

## Files LEFT UNCHANGED (Correctly Preserve the Reveal)

### **Act3/03_02_Zoo_Rescue.md** ‚úÖ CORRECT
This scene contains **Jewels' confession** about their love and the Jade Heart Stone. This is the INTENDED reveal moment. No changes needed.

**Key Quote (Preserved):**
> "Sappho and I..." Jewels whispers, her voice thick with emotion, "we made a vow on this stone. It was to be our secret‚Äîa promise that our love could bridge any divide."

### **Act3/03_03_Shifters_Fight.md** ‚úÖ CORRECT
Villains say "the lovers" and "trysting spot" - but this happens AFTER the Act 3.2 reveal, so it's appropriate. No changes needed.

### **Act0/00_03_The_Lynx_Guide.md** ‚úÖ CORRECT
Contains general reference to "loved one's face" as example of mental anchor - not specific to Sappho/Jewels. No changes needed.

## GM Guidance: Running the Mystery

### Before Act 3.2 - Plant Subtle Clues

**When players ask about Sappho and Jewels:**
- "They work together with remarkable coordination"
- "They seem to communicate without words"
- "They've been practicing together in the woods"
- "Other animals seem curious about how close they've become"
- "They volunteered for this mission together"

**What players might speculate:**
- "Are they spies?"
- "Are they planning something?"
- "Maybe they're just really good friends?"
- "It's nice to see cross-species cooperation working"

**What players should NOT know:**
- They are romantically involved
- Their meetings are romantic, not tactical
- The depth of their emotional bond

### At Act 3.2 - The Reveal

When Jewels produces the Jade Heart Stone and confesses their love:
- Players should be SURPRISED
- The idea of a dog and lynx in love should feel unusual and touching
- The word "love" carved on the stone in both languages becomes emotionally significant
- Their sacrifice (keeping this secret, using the stone to save everyone) has more weight

### After the Reveal

Once players know, retrospective moments become sweet:
- "Oh, THAT's why they were so coordinated!"
- "The 'coordination drills' were dates!"
- "That's actually really cute"
- "Wait, so when they said 'partner' they meant..."

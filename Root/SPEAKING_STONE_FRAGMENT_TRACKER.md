# Speaking Stone Fragment Tracker

## Overview

The Speaking Stone consists of **12 total pieces**:
- **11 shell fragments** (white/silver glowing pieces from the shattered egg-shaped stone)
- **1 jade heart stone** (green jade core, inscribed with "love" in Dog-Conlang and Lynx-Conlang)

The shell must be complete (all 11 fragments) before the heart can be inserted. The heart activates and completes the stone, restoring communication and awakening new consciousness.

## Narrative Milestones

**Use these descriptions as PCs collect fragments:**

**1-3 fragments:**
> "The fragments resonate softly, like distant whispers calling to their siblings. The magic is faint, but it's there—a promise of what was lost."

**4-6 fragments:**
> "The pieces hum together now, creating harmonies that weren't there before. When you hold them close, you can almost hear echoes of voices—dog barks, lynx calls, sounds that should mean something but remain just out of reach."

**7-9 fragments:**
> "The resonance is growing stronger. The fragments pull toward each other like magnets, eager to reunite. The glow brightens when they're close, and the air around them feels charged with potential."

**10-11 fragments (All shell pieces):**
> "The shell is nearly complete. The fragments form a broken egg, gaps between them like wounds waiting to heal. The magic is powerful now, almost overwhelming. But something is missing—you can feel the emptiness at the center where the heart should be."

**All 12 pieces (Shell + Heart):**
> "As the jade heart settles into the center of the shell, everything changes. The fragments rush together, seams sealing with light. The word 'love' carved on the heart glows in two languages, and suddenly—SUDDENLY—you understand. The Speaking Stone is whole. Communication floods back like a dam breaking. And with it comes something new: consciousness awakening across the zoo, in every cage and enclosure. The Stone doesn't just translate—it illuminates."

## Fail-Safe System

**If PCs are short on fragments before the final fight:**

1. **The Reunion Scene (Before Scene 3.2):**
   - Sappho and Jewels embrace
   - Lynx Shaman appears with 1-2 additional fragments
   - "We sensed you were collecting them. We've been safeguarding these."
   
2. **Shapeshifter Confession:**
   - During villain reveal, Mehitabel mentions "keeping the rest as insurance"
   - Makes it narratively justified why they have exactly the right number
   
3. **Final Count Before Heart:**
   - GM ensures PCs have exactly 11 shell fragments
   - Then Jewels provides the 12th piece (heart)
   - Stone mends and activates

**This system is PLAYER-INVISIBLE but GM-flexible.**

## Physical Props

**For the table:**
- 11 identical tokens (white/silver stones or glass beads) for shell fragments
- 1 unique green token (jade-colored stone or glass bead) for the heart
- Small bag or egg-shaped container to hold them
- Visual aid: Draw/show the egg with 11 puzzle-piece sections and heart center

**When presenting fragments:**
- Hand physical tokens to players as they collect them
- Let them see the collection grow
- When they get the heart, make it ceremonial - pass the green token with narrative weight

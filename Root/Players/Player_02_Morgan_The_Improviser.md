- **Entertaining:** Keeps energy high and makes sessions memorable
- **Brave:** Willing to take risks and fail spectacularly
- **Roleplay-Focused:** Embodies Cinder's warrior heart fully

### Potential Challenges:

- **Ignores Obvious Solutions:** May bypass investigation scenes entirely with brute force
- **Sequence Breaking:** Might attempt to rescue both Sappho AND Jewels simultaneously
- **Rule-Bending:** "Can I use my Fight skill to intimidate the Speaking Stone into fixing itself?"

## Typical Player Behaviors

### Actions Morgan Might Attempt:

1. **Act 1, Scene 1 (Harbor Heist):**
   - "I want to grab a fish and throw it at the Gull Boss to distract them!"
   - "Can I climb the rigging and do a dramatic leap onto the boat?"
   - "Instead of fighting the gulls, can I convince them we're ALSO victims and turn them against whoever broke the Stone?"

2. **Act 1, Scene 3 (The Aftermath):**
   - "I don't care about the investigation—I'm tracking Sappho and Jewels' scent RIGHT NOW, full sprint!"
   - "I challenge the Sea Dog Captain to single combat to prove cats aren't betrayers!"
   - "Can I intimidate the shattered stone fragments into telling me where the rest went?"

3. **Act 2 (Investigation Scenes):**
   - **Scene 1:** "I'm going to follow the brake fluid trail backwards to find where the saboteur bought it!"
   - **Scene 2:** "I push the Sea Dog INTO the water fountain to snap them out of their rage!"
   - **Scene 3:** "I eat some of the catnip to see if it gives me visions of who spread it!" (This will go poorly)
   - **Scene 4:** "I demand the Lynx Shaman speak plainly or I'm leaving!" (Compel: Warrior's Heart)

4. **Act 3 (Rescue Scenes):**
   - **Pound Rescue:** "I'm just going to open ALL the cages and cause maximum chaos!"
   - **Zoo Rescue:** "I tackle every cat that looks suspicious until we find the shapeshifters!"
   - **Final Fight:** "I throw shell fragments at the shapeshifters like shuriken!"

### Sequence-Breaking Potential:

**HIGH RISK: Skipping Investigation**
- Morgan may try to go straight to confrontation, bypassing clues
- Solution: Make confrontation NEED the information from investigation (can't find zoo without clues)

**HIGH RISK: Unorthodox Solutions**
- "What if we just steal the silver tag in broad daylight by creating a distraction?"
- Solution: Let creative plans work, but add complications/costs

**MEDIUM RISK: Combat-Solving Social Problems**
- May try to Fight their way through faction negotiations
- Solution: Make it clear this will make things WORSE (compel their Trouble)

**LOW RISK: Breaking Dramatic Moments**
- Morgan might crack jokes during serious scenes
- Solution: This can actually relieve tension; embrace it as Cinder's coping mechanism

## GM Guidance for Managing Morgan

### What Works Well:
✅ **"Yes, and..." their ideas** - Even if they're wild, find a way to make them work (with consequences)
✅ **Action scenes** - Morgan will make combat cinematic and memorable
✅ **Complications, not failures** - When Morgan's plan fails, make it SPECTACULAR
✅ **Compels** - Morgan will accept compels enthusiastically if they create drama

### Potential Pitfalls:
❌ **Don't shut down creativity** - "No, you can't do that" kills Morgan's engagement
❌ **Don't make them sit still** - Long investigation scenes without action will bore them
❌ **Don't punish improvisation** - If they try something wild, let it work (with a cost)
❌ **Don't require strict adherence to the plan** - Morgan doesn't work from plans

### How to Challenge Morgan Productively:
1. **Consequences:** "Sure, you can free all the dogs, but now Animal Control is on HIGH ALERT. How do you get Sappho out?"
2. **Ethical Dilemmas:** "The shapeshifter is cornered and begging for mercy. What does Cinder do?"
3. **Restraint:** "The Lynx Shaman says violence will doom the alliance. Can you solve this WITHOUT fighting?"
4. **Protecting Others:** Cinder's Trouble involves protecting their human; put the human in danger

## Scenario Improvements Based on Morgan's Play Style

### Issues Morgan Will Expose:

**Problem #1: Linear Investigation Assumption**
- **Issue:** Morgan may try to skip straight to rescuing Sappho without gathering clues
- **Fix Needed:** Make sure the pound's location isn't obvious without investigation
- **Suggested Addition:** Add a scene where attempting to find the pound without clues leads to false leads, wasted time, or getting lost

**Problem #2: Combat Bypassing Puzzles**
- **Issue:** "I just Fight my way into the AC office and grab the silver tag!"
- **Fix Needed:** This should be ALLOWED but costly (alerts guards, jeopardizes rescue)
- **Suggested Addition:** Add GM Guidance noting that brute-force solutions work but create "Heat" (a countdown clock to Human Intervention)

**Problem #3: Fragment Collection Feels Passive**
- **Issue:** If fragments are just "found" during scenes, Morgan might not engage with collection
- **Fix Needed:** Make some fragments require ACTION to obtain
- **Suggested Addition:** One fragment is held by a hostile NPC who must be convinced/defeated/outwitted

**Problem #4: Social Scenes Lack Action**
- **Issue:** Morgan may get bored during faction diplomacy in Act 1, Scene 3
- **Fix Needed:** Add action beats even in social scenes
- **Suggested Addition:** A fight almost breaks out between Dog and Lynx factions—PCs must physically intervene

**Problem #5: Too Many "Can't Do That" Moments**
- **Issue:** If the scenario assumes specific solutions, Morgan will find alternatives
- **Fix Needed:** Every scene needs multiple viable approaches
- **Suggested Addition:** Add "Alternate Approaches" section to each scene listing Combat, Stealth, Social, and Magic solutions

## Best Moments for Morgan

Morgan will SHINE during:
- **Act 1, Scene 1:** The Harbor Heist (combat + fish-throwing shenanigans)
- **Act 2, Scene 2:** Hydrant Havoc (physical comedy + stopping a rampaging dog)
- **Act 3, Scene 1:** Pound Rescue (high-risk infiltration + potential for chaos)
- **Act 3, Scene 3:** Final Battle (Epic confrontation with shapeshifters)

## Red Flags to Watch For

If Morgan seems disengaged, it might be because:
1. **Too much talking, not enough doing**
2. **Their creative ideas are being rejected**
3. **The scene feels railroaded** with only one "correct" solution
4. **There's no immediate physical stakes**

## Creative Solutions to Embrace

### Examples of Morgan's Ideas That Should Work:

**"I want to recruit the Seagull Mafia to help us!"**
- **Response:** "Amazing! Roll Rapport or Provoke. If you succeed, they agree—but they want a cut of the fish AND a favor later."

**"Can I use the Speaking Stone fragments like a trail of breadcrumbs to find the rest?"**
- **Response:** "YES. That's actually brilliant. They resonate with each other. Give yourself a +2 to Investigate for this."

**"I'm going to jump from the pound's roof into an open window!"**
- **Response:** "Hell yes. Roll Athletics. Success means you're in silently. Fail means you crash through and alert guards, but you're STILL in—just loud."

**"I challenge Ra to single combat for Mogg's freedom!"**
- **Response:** "Ra laughs and accepts. This becomes a Fight conflict, but if you win, Ra has to flee in shame and drop fragments."

## Playtest Feedback Morgan Might Provide

**What Morgan Will Say:**
- "I loved the heist scene! More action like that!"
- "The investigation in Act 2 felt slow—I wanted to just GO DO SOMETHING."
- "The zoo excavator scene was PERFECT. I got to do cool stunts!"
- "I wish there were more opportunities to use Cinder's Fight skill outside of combat—like intimidation or dramatic displays."

**Suggested Scenario Adjustments:**
1. Add "aggressive investigation" options (intimidate witnesses, make dramatic declarations)
2. Include environmental action in every scene (climbing, leaping, breaking things)
3. Ensure at least one combat/physical conflict per act
4. Add consequences that reward bold action (not just punish failure)

## Summary

**Morgan is your "Chaos Tester" who will find unconventional solutions and push boundaries.** If the scenario can accommodate Morgan's wild ideas with "yes, and..." GMing, it's flexible enough for any table.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't write Morgan's plans into the scenario—write REACTIONS to unpredictable plans. Include frameworks for handling chaos rather than preventing it. Morgan will make the scenario fun and memorable if you embrace the improvisation.

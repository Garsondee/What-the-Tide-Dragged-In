# Player Profile: Jordan "The Lore Keeper"

## Player Character
**Plays:** Driftwood (Elderly House Cat and Keeper of Silverfield Lore)

## Player Personality
Jordan is a thoughtful, detail-oriented player who loves worldbuilding and continuity. They remember every NPC name, location detail, and bit of lore from previous sessions. Jordan asks questions to understand HOW the world works, not to break it, but their thoroughness can reveal inconsistencies. They're helpful, patient, and genuinely excited about the setting.

## Play Style Characteristics

### Strengths:
- **Excellent Memory:** Remembers details from Act 0 and references them later
- **Worldbuilding Enthusiast:** Asks about history, culture, and how magic works
- **Collaborative:** Helps other players remember important details
- **Engaged:** Takes notes and creates their own lore documents

### Potential Challenges:
- **Continuity Questions:** "Wait, in the last adventure we learned X, but now you're saying Y?"
- **Deep Lore Dives:** May spend 30 minutes asking about Lynx clan rituals
- **Premature Revelations:** Driftwood's Lore skill may let them figure out mysteries too early
- **Setting Consistency:** "If the Speaking Stone enabled communication, how did Act 0 work?"

## Typical Player Behaviors

### Questions Jordan Might Ask:

**Act 0 Continuity:**
- "So we could all understand each other in the previous adventure because of the Speaking Stone? Has it always existed?"
- "Did anyone in the previous adventure mention the Stone or the grove?"
- "How long has the alliance between Cats, Dogs, and Lynx been working?"

**Worldbuilding Details:**
- "What's the Lynx clan's formal name? Do they have a hierarchy like the Parliament?"
- "How does shapeshifter magic work in this world? Are there other shapeshifters?"
- "What's the Speaking Stone's origin? Who made it and why?"
- "Do the Seagull Mafia have their own language? Why aren't THEY affected by the Stone breaking?"

**Cultural Questions:**
- "What are Lynx conlang rituals like? Can Driftwood know some phrases from historical research?"
- "What was the previous war between the Dogs and Lynx about? How did it end?"
- "If the Stone awakens consciousness in zoo animals, are there other places with awakened non-cat/dog/lynx animals?"

## Sequence-Breaking Potential:

**HIGH RISK: Solving Mysteries with Lore Checks**
- Driftwood's Great (+4) Lore may reveal too much too fast
- Solution: Use "Success with Cost" model—they know the answer but it's incomplete or cryptic

**MEDIUM RISK: Meta-Knowledge from Act 0**
- May reference events/NPCs from previous adventure that create continuity issues
- Solution: Ensure Act 0 and Act 1 timelines align cleanly

**LOW RISK: Analysis Paralysis**
- May want to research everything before acting
- Solution: Time pressure and urgency in scenes

## Scenario Improvements Based on Jordan's Play Style

### Issues Jordan Will Expose:

**Problem #1: Act 0 Continuity**
- **Issue:** "If the Speaking Stone has always enabled communication, it should be mentioned in Act 0."
- **Fix:** Add subtle references in Act 0 to universal communication being "natural" without revealing the Stone's existence

**Problem #2: Seagull Mafia Communication**
- **Issue:** "Why can we still understand the gulls if the Stone is broken?"
- **Fix:** Clarify that gulls (birds) use simpler communication/body language that cats naturally understand

**Problem #3: Lynx Clan Lore Gaps**
- **Issue:** "What's the Lynx clan's relationship to the Stone historically?"
- **Fix:** Add lore that Lynx shamans KNEW about the Stone but kept it secret (warding tradition)

**Problem #4:** Speaking Stone Origins**
- **Issue:** "Who created the Speaking Stone? How old is it? Why has no one studied it?"
- **Fix:** Add "Ancient Mystery" section acknowledging these as unanswerable (for now)—fey origin, pre-human, deliberately forgotten

## Best Moments for Jordan

- **Act 1, Scene 3:** Using Lore to recognize the Standing Stones' significance
- **Act 2, Scene 4:** Deep conversation with Lynx Shaman about old alliances
- **Epilogue:** Understanding the long-term implications of awakened consciousness

## Summary

**Jordan is your "Consistency Tester"** who will find lore gaps and timeline issues. Address their questions by adding robust worldbuilding details to the setting document.

**Key Takeaway:** Build a "Lore FAQ" section addressing common Jordan-type questions so GMs have answers ready.

# Playtest Player Profiles Overview

This folder contains detailed profiles of four playtest players, each designed to stress-test different aspects of "What the Tide Dragged In." These profiles help identify potential issues, improve scenario robustness, and provide GM guidance for handling different play styles.

## The Four Players

### 1. **Alex "The Logical Detective"** (plays Whisker)
**Tests:** Narrative consistency, plot logic, clue coherence
**Strength:** Excellent at connecting dots and solving mysteries
**Challenge:** Will notice plot holes and ask inconvenient logical questions
**Key Concern:** "Does this make sense?"

### 2. **Morgan "The Improviser"** (plays Cinder)
**Tests:** Scenario flexibility, alternate solutions, action pacing
**Strength:** Creative problem-solving and entertaining gameplay
**Challenge:** Will attempt sequence-breaking and unorthodox solutions
**Key Concern:** "Can I try this crazy idea?"

### 3. **Riley "The Empath"** (plays Silk)
**Tests:** Emotional depth, NPC development, consequences
**Strength:** Brings heart and relationship focus to gameplay
**Challenge:** Will ask about feelings, motivations, and collateral damage
**Key Concern:** "How does everyone feel about this?"

### 4. **Jordan "The Lore Keeper"** (plays Driftwood)
**Tests:** Worldbuilding consistency, continuity, setting depth
**Strength:** Excellent memory and enthusiasm for lore
**Challenge:** Will notice continuity errors and want deep lore answers
**Key Concern:** "How does this fit with what we learned before?"

## How to Use These Profiles

### For Scenario Design:
1. Read each player profile
2. Note the "Issues They Will Expose" sections
3. Implement the "Suggested Additions" to strengthen the scenario
4. Add GM guidance for handling each play style

### For Playtesting:
- Have these profiles in mind when recruiting playtesters
- Try to get a mix of these personality types
- Pay attention to which issues each player type encounters
- Use their feedback to refine the scenario

### For GMs Running the Adventure:
- Identify which of your real players match these archetypes
- Read the relevant "GM Guidance" sections
- Prepare for the types of questions each player will ask
- Use the "Best Moments" sections to highlight each player's strengths

## Collective Impact on Scenario

If the scenario can handle ALL FOUR of these players simultaneously, it's ready for any table:

✅ **Alex** ensures the plot holds up logically
✅ **Morgan** ensures there are multiple viable approaches
✅ **Riley** ensures emotional stakes and NPC depth
✅ **Jordan** ensures worldbuilding consistency

## Key Improvements Identified

Based on these four player types, the scenario needs:

1. **Strong Worldbuilding Foundation** (for Jordan)
   - Clear lore about the Speaking Stone's origins
   - Consistent timeline with Act 0
   - Cultural details about each faction

2. **Flexible Scene Structure** (for Morgan)
   - Multiple solution paths (combat, stealth, social, magic)
   - "Yes, and..." frameworks for handling improvisation
   - Consequences instead of hard failures

3. **Emotional Scaffolding** (for Riley)
   - NPC motivations and feelings
   - Epilogue addressing "what happens next"
   - Opportunities for mercy and redemption

4. **Logical Coherence** (for Alex)
   - Answers to "why hasn't anyone found this before?"
   - Consistent clue trails
   - Evidence that holds up to scrutiny

## Using Player Profiles for Iteration

After each playtest session:
1. Note which player type identified which issues
2. Implement fixes based on their feedback
3. Re-test those areas with similar player types
4. Document solutions in GM Guidance sections

These profiles are living documents—update them as you discover new player behaviors and scenario challenges.
